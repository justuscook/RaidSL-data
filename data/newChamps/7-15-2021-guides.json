Delver have tricky skill but essential debuff on this game: single target weaken 25% and aoe decrease defend 60%.

A lot of conditions need to met right?\n\nFirst thing we need to consider are the masteries. This Delver is built for UNM clan boss.

Note that without two Maneaters it would be difficult to replicate this success. They are the key element to this composition.\n\nDelver's skills are tricky but Ma'shalled A3 can place a heal reduction debuff on the clan boss. This comp has a 2:1 ratio  of turns starting from turn 7 (if you're confused, visit deadwoodjedi.com for speed tunes). This means she can can consistently keep weaken and Decrease Def on CB, unless it's magic affinity. \n\nWhat if you dont have Ma'shalled? Theoritically you can make her work. If you use the Batman comp, Delver may be enough because her A1 can hit heal reduction debuff. However, if you want more consistency, consider using the cursed artifact set that has a 50% chance to land heal reduction debuff on one of the champions.\n\nYou can find a video of a UNM run with Delver in the following video:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/09m2lNnFxYo \n\n2. Spider 20 run under 1 minute\n\nDelver can help with spider 20. The featured team is: Royalguard (lead and affinity tank), Seer, Delver, Coldheart, and Renegade. Since our champion can place Decrease Defense as long as there is a weaken debuff, Seer can help enable Delver on auto. The Speed tunes for those runs are, 210 CH, 205 Seer, 203 Delver, 165 RG, and 95 Renegade. The turn order is CH A2, Seer A2, Delver A3, RG A2, CH A3, Seer A3, Renegade reduce cooldown.\n\nWhy not stag knight or tayrel for Decrease Def? What is good about this composition is that all spiderlings  are cleared so they dont get a chance to get a turn. This speeds up the runs. If stag knight or tayrel are used, they cant kill spiderlings with their skills because does not hit as hard as delver does. \n\nThe video below demonsrates\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/sYM3EIM \n\n3.

It is actually advised not to book her since lowering the cooldown on her other skills means she uses her A1 less. \n\nAlthough you don’t need masteries, building masteries will definitely improve her performance. If you do decide to build her masteries, I suggest the Offense and Support tree. The only important mastery on the offense tree is Crit rate to help get her to 100%. On the support tree, you want to get accuracy, Lore of Steel for extra stats and Evil Eye for additional control. She doesn’t need any T5 or T6 mastery to do her job, although Giant Slayer for additional damage can be handy in faction wars.

A core concept for clan boss is speed tuning your team around skullcrusher counterattack.\n\nIf your SC has 171 speed and your other heroes have 172-181 speed you will be able to have counterattack up for heroes on both clan boss AOE attacks. This leads to massive damage output increase with t6 masteries and higher reliability of runs. This is conditional on no TM boosting masteries in the team and this is the classical speed tune. There are other variants of tunes discussed in Late Game+ pages. This speed can also work on UNM if the first two AOE attacks are skipped.\n\nSC can help achieve high levels of dragon and Fire Knight. He can also be useful on Spider 20 as a tank (see the Renegade guide for reference).\n\nThe following videos showcases a simple Skullcrusher tune for Nightmare Clan Boss. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/3WrnDqIRKKY\n\nA few takeaways for teams with counterattack in the video:\n\n1. Always keep the counterattack cycles even. Have a dedicated champion to take the stun or something to prevent it (block debuffs of cleanse)\n2. You want attack down to be on the clan boss especially in the latter rounds, get a hero with a1 attack down\n3. The order in which the heroes counterattack is important and it's set up in the original screen. The first to make the counter in this example is the leader, then banshee, then bogwalker, then rhazin. Have your debuff extenders go last and important debuffers go first\n4. You can see how Rhazin in Stalwart is not surviving long enough without the lifesteal set without a healer\n5. Having Defence Down and Weaken considerably improves the damage\n6. Rhazin, Banshee and Skullcrusher have Late Game+ stats here, so focus on at least 3 key NM first\n\nThere are more complicated variations for clan boss discussed in Late Game+ guide and combinations with other Epic and Legendary heroes that can be built to tackle the most difficult content",

Many players will chose 'retribution' on tier 5 defence mastery, however you might run into a potential danger of triggering enemy speed/support champions cycle of revenge and/or timely intervention which might cost you speed advantage resulting in a loss. \n\nFor tier 6 masteries, like with vast majority of end game arena AOE damage dealers 'Helm Smasher' is the highest priority mastery due to maximum potential to deal the most damage to the targets.",

Accuracy is absolutely not needed as she doesnt apply any debuffs on any of her abilities.\n  \nIdeally the best results will be from Savage + Cruel sets or 3 sets of Cruel gear on her, however due to potential difficulties in obtaining pieces from these sets other sets can be used such as Attack, Immunity and lastly just 6 odd pieces from broken sets, as long as overall stats are good. However the most universal set of gear you can have on your damage dealer is Immunity. Immunity allows you to ignore enemy Tormins, crowd control Hegemons, passives from Krisks, etc. basically anything that might put debuff on your champion. For the main stats you absolutely most have the following:\n\n\nGlove - crit dmg %\nChest - atk %\nBoots - speed or atk % ( if enough speed can be attained from sub stats ).\nRing - atk\nAmulet - crit dmg\nBanner - atk\n\nWhen you are gearing any arena champion the most important part to keep in mind is speed balance between your champions. If you are running a team that is designed to go first, that is where Elhain shines, all your champions have to be speed tuned, so more often than not you will be forced to use speed boots to make sure you have enough speed. So sub stats on rest of the gear are very important if the required amount of Attack and Crit Damage needs to be achieved.",

Has a chance on reducing Turn Meter, but this is not dependable.\n•        A2: Heals all allies by percentage of Warlord’s HP, and places block debuffs.\n\nAs an offensive skill lock champion, you want Warlord to be as fast as possible to go before all enemy champions (with or without the help of a TM booster). You also want the Warlord A2 and A3 to come around as often as possible in order to repeatedly lock enemy skills out and heal your own team.\n\nFor a “debuff” build (even though skill lock is not a debuff), Eagle Eye support tree build is best to maximise the Accuracy. Other useful masteries to note are:\n\n-        Accuracy increasing masteries [Pinpoint] [Charged Focus] \n-        Shield increasing [Shieldbearer] [Rejuventation]\n-        Speed stat increasing [Lore of Steel]\n-        TM reduction [Retribution] with [Evil Eye] for more TM control\n",

      "desc": "Warlord can shine in difficult content in Raid where other champions struggle. He can lock down powerful enemy combinations, such as Siphi and Rotos above floor 110, provide shields and heals against Scarab Lord, as well as other 2 spider bosses. Note that some champion secret skills cannot be locked (e.g., Peril by Mortu) or some champions have a fasts turn around for their skills (e.g. Rotos extra turn).\n\nOne of the annoying aspects of DT waves with Siphi and Rotos is their passive synergy: (Siphi removes all debuffs from Rotos the Lost Groom at the start of their turn if they are on the same team.) This renders standard Crowd Control, such as freeze, sleep, stun, or even block skill debuffs ineffective. \n\nFurthermore, if the enemy Siphi gets a turn, her block debuffs makes your life harder unless you strip the buffs first. Either way, putting skills on cooldown by Warlord or Basher (budget Warlord) is effective - as it is not considered a debuff and cannot be removed. If you have speed and TM buffs, your warlord can cycle around to using a3, forever denying the enemy champions to use any ability other than A1.  \n\nYour other team members should complement Warlord. I recommend 1-2 more support/healer, and 2-3 damage champions. In this video a team of Krisk, Siphi, with Rotos and Candraphone were selected. There are many other possibilities to construct a team for those floors such as: Seer, Duchess, Nethril, Raglin, and BEK.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/5ZhN7SXKHio \n\n[Warlord AI] Getting Warlord to prioritise A3 is tough. It seems that a Siphi lead with block debuffs helps warlord to priortise A3, otherwise you may need to manual things in Doom Tower in the first few rounds. Likewise in arena defence, it is recommended to pair a fast warlord with a fast siphi. \n\nYou can see a more detailed guide on how the same build works in Arena on the next page of the guide\n",

The top choice and the most expensive one: an Immunity set and perfect stats (600+ Accuracy, enough speed to go second after turn meter boost)\n\nThis build is more budget and uses ACC sets or Perception sets from the forge, the latter being the best in slot if you're lucky with the stats and substats. We're aiming for 3 stats, priorititising ACC,  SPD and HP in that order. If you're aiming for low gold you might get away with about 300 accuracy at the moment. Around 500 is the benchmark in gold 4 and bottom platinum. At the top of platinum it's not unusual to build 600+ Accuracy Serris and then focus on other stats.\n\nGlove: HP % \nChest: Accuracy\nBoots: Speed \nRing: HP / DEF\nAmulet: DEF/HP (With Accuracy Substats)\nBanner: Accuracy \n\nACC chest and a Banner are a MUST and we'll try to get as much SPD and ACC in substats of the rest of the items. SPD is also very important because she needs to go right after our turn meter booster, but before the nuker. If we're too slow, chances are the enemies will get ahead of her. To make sure nobody cuts into your turn order you can tune your Serris speed at arena calculators, e.g. https://www.deadwoodjedi.com/wystix-calculator \n\nShe places a shield based on her Max.HP, and hitting that shield will mean getting Fear, so the more HP the bigger the shield, so the glove is preferrable to be HP%. There's really no point in building her for damage with this build, even though her A2 can hit decently.",

      "desc": "Mortu is famous for being a challenge during the campaign as a final boss, but he doesn’t seem to hit nearly as hard and as often when he joins your collection.\n\nThis guide focuses on how you can use Mortu Maccab in the platinum arena setting. He has one major and one minor role:\n\n•        Block Revive (A4: Peril): post-Rotos nerf, Mortu is one of the reliable block revive strikers with a powerful conditional ability that ignores defence, shields, and block damage. It is a 2 hitter that is enough to kill most champions (in particular non-magic affinity).\n•        Block buffs (A2): Block buff aoe attack is incredibly powerful if it lands, as most power buffs including gear abilities (e.g., swift parry with unkillable) and passive abilities (e.g., Seeker defence up) can be a real nuisance. However, Mortu is not the fastest champion with a base speed of 94, so you are likely seeking block buffs to cut in opportunistically after several turns.\n\nAs a defensive and potentially block revive damage champion, he provides a win condition for highly defensive teams. However, it is really hard to decide how to gear and choose masteries for Mortu. \n\nOn the one hand, you want him to survive, but still do enough damage when Peril is available to deliver the kill. For these reasons, you will want either:\n\n•        Flawless Execution: no need for Helmsmasher as he ignores 100% defence\n•        Selfless Defender: at time of writing, it is believed that this will trigger Peril\n\nNote that Peril can be triggered when Mortu is receiving hits. Peril doesn’t need books, which also make him somewhat viable for low spenders.\n",

This allows your slower team to tank damage from a variety of teams.

Champions such as Seeker, Siphi or Black Knight are excellent for this role.\n2.        [Resurrect] As you build up a sustain team, a defensive resurrection champion is critical, such as Duchess, Siphi, Raglin or Maulie.\n3.        [Anti-Speed] Someone to mess up the enemy speed tune is critical too, to disrupt the attack order (e.g., DPS goes before defence down), and reduce the damage your team takes: Valk, Tormin and Hegemon are popular options in platinum.\n4.        [Strengthen or Ally Protect] Ally protect across the team will mean Mortu can take more damage and trigger Peril more often.\n\nHere is a video showcasing Mortu, with a very strong team fulfilling the above roles: 1-2. Siphi, 3. Nuke Hegemon, 4. Lydia for Hegemon block revive on initial nuke. \n\nThe idea is that:\n•        If the enemy uses a speed team, Hegemon can upset them by killing a few key members or locking their skills\n•        If they try to revive, Lydia kicks in. Lydia also is helpful down the line by adding the strengthen buff, AOE Defence Down and Weaken as well as block cooldown skills.\n•        Siphi here is for defence up and general debuff protection.\n\nVideo: https://youtu.be/ujgvPg-ycBs \n",

The Warmaster path is preferred due to the nature of high HP of all the enemies, but Fearsome Presence will make traversing the waves of enemies much easier.

Depending on how many are stunned and the overall tankiness of your team, choose to use her A2 to prevent the enemies from using a skill. This can be seen being done on one of the Valkyries right before the enemy's turn. Only do this if the other targets are not a threat. The main threats for the first wave would be Warlord and Martyr and Valkyries on the second wave. Since Valkyrie and Martyr are the stronger affinity, there is a good chance the skill will not land and the A2 should be thought as an emergency single target control technique.\n\nDuring the boss fight, she will help control the minions until they are down.

    {
      "desc": "Hegemon is arguably one of the best arena champions in the entire game no matter what level your account is at. He provides excellent detterence in your arena defense and has a variety of playstyles for arena offence as well. Hegemon can be built for near unrivaled crowd control and turn meter manipulation that can give you the first move in the battle even though the enemy speed booster is faster than yours.\n\nThis guide will explore the Crowd Control (CC) build catered towards late game players, however the concepts remain the same regardless of the account level.\n\nHegemon's strongest ability in arena offense is his A1 when combined with the Evil Eye mastery. This allows you to guarantee going first against the enemy by using a Hegemon, reducing their Turn Meter and applying Decrease-Speed on the main turn meter booster and possibly a second target depending on who the A1's second hit randomly selects. A hegemon who is built fast enough in a double turn meter boosting team can even take two turns before your nuker due to his passive, allowing you to apply evil eye and decrease speed on their turn meter booster and then cycle back around to use A2 on the enemy team and potentially lock them out further.\n\nThe masteries are all focused around landing/extending debuffs and locking out your enemy. Fearsome Presence is the T6 mastery of choice, because it increases the chance of your artifact set activating on the enemy (sets don't need accuracy). Evil eye is arguably the most important mastery for a CC hegemon because it allows you to reduce the enemy's turn meter by 20% on up to two targets. This allows you to boost first before an opponent who has a faster Arbiter. All other masteries are around maximising your accuracy, extending debuffs (Master Hexer) or adding survivability for Hegemon if he's used in your arena defense.",

    {
      "desc": "The primary stats of a CC hegemon are speed and accuracy. Building your Hegemon with speed allows you to fend off enemies in your arena defense if they bring their own Hegemon and aren't as fast as you. In addition to that, a faster Hegemon takes more turns throughout the fight and provides more lockout. \n\nIt is VERY important that you do NOT build any crit rate into your CC hege. If your Hegemon crits the enemy and they have Cycle of Revenge T5 defense mastery then they have a chance of increasing their turn meter and potentially ruining your speed cut. A hybrid role (CC+nuke) Hegemon is a bad choice because it limits your options in arena offence because of this mastery.\n\nIt's also wise to build as little attack/damage as possible so that the enemy booster doesn't activate the Resurgent defense mastery that can remove the Speed Down debuff.\n\nThe best artifact sets are Stun, Taunting and Daze. Each set is situationally as good as the other and it comes down to what line up you have and what the enemy has. You may want to avoid Taunting if the enemy has a blender because it will severely hurt your team. You may also want to avoid Daze if you have a debuffer that also attacks at the same time such as Stag Knight because it will wake them up. Taunting has the highest chance of the sets to activate so if you build this then make your Hegemon as tanky as possible with HP% gloves and DEF neck/ring with HP% substat due to the scaling of his base stats. Stun provides the most versatility and complete lockout, albeit with a lower chance of activating.\n\nItem Main Stats:\nGlove: NOT Crit Rate%, use anything with speed/acc substats.\nChest: Accuracy\nBoots: Speed\nRing: Any\nAmulet: Any - use whatever has the highest accuracy.\nBanner: Accuracy - use whatever has the highest speed.\n",

This guide explains how a single Seeker build can be useful for a wide variety of game areas from Ultra-Nightmare Clan Boss to platinum arena. The key to Seeker is in the support and control abilities, turn meter boosting, attack up buff, automatic defence up that trigger when hit, and taunt on default attack. \n\nMastery wise, Seeker is not a key damage or healing champion. He can be fantastic as a support and he is definitely worth fully booking in the late game.\n\nTherefore, if you're using Seeker for clan boss [Warmaster] is the correct t6 mastery, along with [Retribution] and [Deterrence] for extra attacks. In arena this also grants a chance to taunt. In the late game builds the equipment like accuracy banners and great hall bonuses are more readily available, making it possible to switch to better survivability and team utility, like in this mastery build.\n\nNote that this build does not have any turn meter boosting masteries or skill cooldowns. This is the selection required for unkillable and counterattack clan boss teams that must cycle the skills in a pre-determined sequence.",

      "desc": "The Seeker finds itself as a support champion in both arena and the clan boss (CB). As the CB usually requires speed tuning, you will find that if you only have 1 Seeker, the CB needs to dictate the gear. For example, the famous BAT unkillable UNM setup requires Seeker to be at 248-263 speed. This makes the Seeker also an ideal 2nd speed booster in Gold 4 or 3x3 arena. \n\nGear wise, speed matching to the rest of team is the most important consideration. I recommend going for 3 sets of speed to meet the late game challenge of a support champion at around 250 speed. This will be suitable for many CB setups as well as Gold 4 arena. In Gold 4, the typically 1st speed lead might have a speed of 300-330 speed with a 20-30% turn meter boost (e.g. Arbiter, Lyssandra, Sethallia, Kymar). This makes Seeker going second ideal, offering the attack up in the process. \n\nDo visit https://www.deadwoodjedi.com/batmaneater for CB guide on Seeker, as well as arena speed tune calculator. The speed of each champion in this setup is critical to making it work, and Unkillable setups have strict requirements for the heroes used in such compositions.\n\nDespite the attack-based Seeker not being a critical damage champion, improving its stats in attack, critical chance, and damage is still important in the long term. In the Batman-Eater speed tune, a 250 speed Seeker, maintaining 100% chance crit and 3000 attack can do over 12m damage on UNM. Ideally the attack and critical damage should be higher. \n\n\nGlove: Crit Damage%/Crit Rate %\nChest: Atk%\nBoots: Speed\nRing: Atk\nAmulet: Crit Damage\nBanner: Atk / Acc",

This ability is also crucial in clan boss teams such as the famous BAT tune, increasing team wide damage and cycling the unkillable skills of other champions faster.   \n\nYou can see how Seeker helps on UNM clan boss achieve excellent results with two Maneaters, who are the backbone of the composition. The damage can be further improved to 1 key UNM and 1 key NM with better equipment\n\nhttps://youtu.be/qGcJppQZp5w \n\n[Arena] Second, is the [A3: Dark Blood] passive, a crucial automatic 60% defence up for the whole team when the Seeker suffers a critical damage. The long cooldown is not suitable for consistent reliance, but in arena when allies are nuked, this is a life saver – significantly reducing damage. \n\n[Arena] His Aura is also a hugely useful defence aura at 30%, which allows him to significantly improve the tanking ability of champions against nuke teams.\n\n[Arena] Finally, is the often overlooked [A1: Devour], which when booked has a 50% to land provoke. This is an important crowd control as the Seeker often goes before other champions and can effectively take out the most crucial enemy champion for a turn.\n\nThe Seeker really shines against nuke teams such as blenders (arbiter, longbeard, sinesha, skullcrown for example), where it gives a 30% defence aura to the defending team and a passive defence up. It can make the difference between a wipe and staying for 2-3 turns to counter and finish the enemy off!  \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx6zUxvk8b0&feature=youtu.be ",

She really starts to shine in the mid game when you face tougher enemies in the dungeons and can accompany you all the way through your quest to acquire your Arbiter.

Reliquary Tender can still help you even very late into the game in areas such as faction wars.\n\nMASTERIES\n\nNo matter where you want to use her, you can go either Defense and Support for maximum survivability and fast response or Offense and Support if you want her to deal some damage, especially on clan boss.\n\nThe most important masteries have been highlighted in this picture. Going Offense into Warmaster will allow your Reliquary Tender to contribute some damage, especially on high level enemies and bosses. Her base damage is low. so there's no point going Offense if you don't take Warmaster. The other option is to pick the Support tree Timely Intervention as it will increase your Turn Meter each time an ally is badly wounded (or killed), thus allowing you to heal them faster.\n\nSpirit Haste and Cycle of Revenge allow you to act even faster when some of your allies are dead or suffer a critical hit. Rapid Response and Arcane Celerity (if you can land your decrease attack) will also contribute to many more turns during long fights than your speed alone would allow.\n\nNote that due to the way her continuous healing works, there is no point taking any of the healing increasing masteries. You can also use Reliquary Tender at level 50 with nearly no masteries if you wish to, as long as she does her job well and doesn't die herself from damage.",

Hegemon pairs very well with Tormin because an Arbiter who lives and revives the other enemy champions will also likely freeze them due to the two TM boosts and attack up buff. \n\nUsing a Hegemon to one shot an enemy in the arena is cheeky and should be done with care. Duchess Lilitu's 25% damage reduction passive will almost surely mean she lives, Seeker is also dangerous in the leader position of the team due to his passive and Sandlashed Survivor is worth avoiding due to her passive providing ally protect. Rotos will always live due to his passive\n\nTeams with likely candidates for shield sets such as Mountain King, Harvest Jack and Skull-Lord are worth skipping because of their high health pool and the shield artifact set. Krisk teams are also worth skipping due to his shield passive and decrease attack too.\n\nGood candidates for a nuke target is a team with primarily attack or HP based champions, double nukers, single target revivers or teams without a reviver support champion at all. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/uxF22dxX-eU \n\nIn the video above Arbiter survives the nuke hit.

You can use heroes that have a 4 turn cooldown with Skullcrusher, so they have a 4:3 tune.\n\nI've been able to 2 key on Force UNM with this setup, but not on void yet. If anyone can calculate the perfect setup for speed that protects against both AOE 2 debuff and stun both on Void and affinity, please let me know! deadwoodjedi has a calculator where such speed tunes can be tested.\n\nSkullcrusher, Vizier and Rhazin are slow speed tuned. Guides for these heroes can be found using the bot.\n\nThis covers the most classical Late Game setups for Skullcrusher. However, there are more ways to utilise the hero, so turn to the next page for more options! \n\n\nA few notes on the video:\n\n* Skullcrusher is the slowest in this comp. The speed of each hero matters and if sepulcher sentinel casts her block debuffs and defense up before the second AOE, skullcrusher gets stunned, breaking the speed tune.\n\n* Steelskull is not very reliable on auto. He will not cleanse the stun as a priority and will not buff defence up if it's on heroes.\n\n* Steelskull is not sufficient as a solo poisoner unless you have a debuff extender like Vizier.\n\n* This composition has potential to reach 2 key if the correct speed tune and better equipment with more crit rate and damage is used.",

It sounds crazy doesn't it?\n\nHowever, This is exactly what we are trying to do. The reason for this is because Souldrinker is a very unique champion. Souldrinker has a passive no other champion in the game has. It puts 2 bombs on the enemy when he dies.\n\nThus, you our Unorthodox Arena Strategy is the following\n- Souldrinker is a part of our Arena Team.\n- Souldrinker gets nuked by enemy and dies.\n- Souldrinker passive triggers putting bombs on enemy.\n- The Enemy team is then put on a 2 turn timer.\n\nThey have 2 turns to remove the Bombs or Kill our remaining heroes. If they can't, the Bombs go off and we win! Pretty Cool Arena Strategy wouldn't you say?\n\nThe Masteries for Souldrinker are the following:\n\nDefense Tree because the Defense tree has several Masteries which allow Souldrinker to take more damage.\nT5 Defense Mastery - Selfless Defender\nT6 Defense Mastery - Bulwark\n\nThese masteries are great because they reduce the damage our team takes. The damage gets redirected to our Souldrinker. This in turn helps our Souldrinker die faster to enable our Arena plan. Once the Souldrinker is sacrificed his passive triggers and places Bombs on the enemy. Support Tree has been chosen as the secondary tree. It grant us the more Accuracy that is needed to land our Bombs on the enemy. \n\nFinally, these Support tree masteries are of use if our Souldrinker gets a turn:\nT4 Support Mastery - Evil Eye\nT5 Support Mastery  - Sniper\n\nIt is unlikely our Souldrinker will survive the enemy nuke, but it can happen. Evil Eye can Decrease Enemy Turn Meter if we use Souldrinker A1 vs. them. Sniper - Can help our A3 skill if we don't have it fully booked. The good thing about Souldrinker is you don't really need to book him for him to be effective in this strategy.",

Teams that have giant shields from the shield set, e.g. Krisk or Harvest Jack also fall into this category\n\nThe same goes for the teams that have immunity sets on them. The bombs won't be effective in this case even if you have lots of accuracy, since they won't land. \n\nDebuff cleansers can also be problematic, e.g. Battlesage or Hakkorn.\n\nHowever, it's a fun and unique strategy to try out and it can work decently depending on the metagame you're facing!",

He is incredibly versatile – serving an irreplaceable role in different arena metagame since release. He primarily serves three roles:\n\n·      Crowd Control (CC): Freezes champions that cannot resist his passive after they get a buff or a turn meter (TM) boost. Has an active taunt and crowd control freeze on A1 and A3\n·      Remove Buffs: Removes buffs from a single champion and hits the target for decent damage\n·      Stall: Delays a potential loss by reviving himself\n \nAs a defensive and a potentially good damage champion, he can also surprise the enemy into neglecting his presence and causing havoc. The downside to Tormin is that his CC procs are not always reliable with only a low to average chance of proccing, so he is not a guaranteed speed arena farmer. His base speed is also fairly low, so he is often used mainly for his passive in the first turn. \n \nFor a damage build, Helmsmasher is often preferred due to its shock damage potential. There are other builds possible with Tormin in terms of masteries including Fearsome Presence for more CC and Eagle Eye for high Accuracy. However, for Platinum arena the damage build can sometimes be the X factor to achieve a competitive edge.\n",

Gear can be flexible and can include: Shield set, Swift parry, Damage gear (savage, crit damage), or broken sets.

Be aware of Siphi / Duchess speed leads that can block debuffs, or immunity set teams. Operates well with a counter-attack from Valk and a defence buff. \n\nVideo: https://youtu.be/ViHG8QqBK0w \n\n2.     [Hegemon Team] Hegemon opening can often kill a dps or two, but enemy Arbiter will resurrect them and Tormin can freeze them after this. \n\nVideo: https://youtu.be/ePKxBEaUxBI \n\n3.     [Stall Team] At arena reset in Platinum at the last hour the race is on to stay there. Tormin adds vital seconds to your defence team game, especially with a swift parry set. Some players avoid attacking Tormin teams.\n\nAdditionally, some blender teams use Tormin instead of Sinesha to add extra control.\n\nJustification for Damage Build: Tormin is often better in a damage build because he can do excellent damage and there is a prevalence of immunity sets or block debuffs in current meta. He has 2 AOE attacks, and a very strong single target attack, so not using him for damage is often a waste. Opponents in general are often unsure what gear Tormin uses, and generally leave him to be attacked last because he might be in a freeze set and his high defence means it is more efficient to attack a damage champion or a healer. This gives Tormin more opportunity to surprise the enemy with damage and crowd control at same time. \n\nMore detailed references to Tormin in Damage Build from MurderInc: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmffwPwR3Y4 \n \nHowever, Tormin in a damage build is not without his issues and there are many challenges:\n\nA.    Easily controlled and focused, hence swift parry is often used. This can be countered by block buffs from champions such Gurptuk.\nB.    His CC procs are temperamental \nC.    His revive ability can be blocked by champions such as Lydia and Inithwe\n\nTormin is also useful in dungeons for Crowd Control and Faction Wars (FW), but in general he is a dedicated arena champion.\n",

For example, a Vizier or Norog would go before the clan boss takes his first turn and place block buffs. This would prevent the passive from triggering.\n\n2) Having a fast tuned Counterattack team. I've heard reports that when Valkyrie is fast tuned (192 speed) and other heroes are at 194-200 speed her passive doesn't boost her enough that she overtakes other heroes.

This guide will focus on how to gear a Seer and build a team to utilize her in Dragon, Ice Golem, and Fire Knight 20.\n\nSeer’s main ability to nuke the waves is her A3, Karma Burn. This ability removes all buffs from allies and enemies, then deal damage proportional to the amount of buffs removed. If your Seer is build right, this skill almost always kills the entire wave if a Defense Down is placed on them.\n\nHow to build a Seer Dungeon team:\n1) The team must consist of champions that can place at least 4 different buffs before she uses her A3. This is important because if there aren’t enough buffs, Seer will use her A2 first. The best/most easily obtainable single champion that can fit this role is Mausoleum Mage with a Shield Set (guide available on the Raid bot). \n\nIf you don’t have him, you can use 2 different champions that place 2 different buffs each or some legendaries if you have them (e.g. Lilitu, Krisk) \n\n2)        The team must include a champion that places an AOE Defense Down, ideally at 100% chance, before she uses her A3. Champions that have both AOE Defense Down and Weaken would be best in slot\n3)        The team should be speed tuned where Seer takes a turn only after the team Buffs and Defense Down debuff is placed.\n4)        Optional: Skill Reset Champion – Prince Kymar or Renegade. Not necessary, but will definitely make the runs faster. If you do use one, the skill reset champion must go after Seer. This allows to recharge the Karma Burn and use it on the second wave to speed run the dungeons\n\n\nThe following Video shows Seer teams for Dragon, Ice Golem and Fire Knight 20\n\nhttps://youtu.be/2ZfyFBkqIoc",

Defence up to protect Krisk and get more damage out of Krisk\n\nKrisk can do a lot of damage even in non-damage builds, and is a champion worth as much investment as you can afford. Krisk is useful for arena and clan boss, and is often used as a shield tank in dungeons, but here we focus on where he shines the greatest: arena. \n\nThere are damage builds for Krisk, but we want to highlight him as a defensive monster to terrorize your enemies, even when solo. Build wise we go down the resistance tree and aim for retribution (A1 is an aoe with decrease speed) and +50 resistance. Lasting gifts is worth getting in support for Krisk’s multiple buffs to allies.\n",

      "desc": "Krisk in a shield set is an easy win vs even the best blender teams (Arbiter, Longbeard, Skullcrown, Sinesha). In action, Krisk often doesn’t do much in earlier rounds due to his low speed. The shield and his passive triggers from any enemy aoe, unless they are protected with an immunity set. Krisk shines in longer battles, especially in 1v1 or 1v2 situations.\n\nKrisk in arena is weak against particular champions, and I detail the ones commonly seen. \n- Lyssandra is typically built with high speed and low resistance. When she attacks Krisk she immeditaly gets debuffed with Decrease ATK and DEF. However, Lyssandra can transfer these debuffs immediately back to Krisk with no accuracy check, meaning Krisk (even a high 700 resistance one) is effectively debuffing himself. The defence down is extremely damaging  Krisk\n- Secondly buff strippers or defence down champions such as Suzerain Katonn and Ghostborn weaken Krisk and its allies without fail, followed up by a nuke from Trunda or similar high damage aoe champions. \n- Thirdly high accuracy (600+) buff stripping champions such as: Madame Serris, Gurgoh, and Yannica\n- Deflection sets (sets in Raid don't require accuracy)\n\nKrisk is a sneaky one despite his size though! When enemy AOEs come in, they hit your team in order of placement, that means not all champions receive damage at the same time. If you put Krisk 2nd (because he doesn't have an aura), that means his reduced attack-defence passive will trigger on the enemy attacker before it hits your 3rd and 4th champion. Watch as Trunda does far less damage and Valk produces a smaller shield. This  forces your opponents to use either immunity gear or have an immunity lead (Siphi, Duchess). So while Krisk does have vulnerabilties as outlined above, he also many smart strengths that can trap ill-prepared attackers.\n\nVideos: \nhttps://youtu.be/INdubQO5F1g \nhttps://youtu.be/0J2MFIbwjaA \nhttps://youtu.be/FFuNvfoKDac \n\nYou can find Krisk in action in PVE content on the next page\n",

This guide will be focused on her as an alternative crowd control (CC) champion build. It's geared towards player vs environment content more than exclusively arena. The masteries for this build focus on keeping Trunda alive and increasing her accuracy so that she can CC and apply AOE HP burn to the enemy. Throughout the support tree you want to prioritise accuracy and turn meter increases. \n\nThe tier 6 mastery can either be Eagle-Eye or Fearsome Presence depending on what accuracy targets you have for the teams you're fighting. \n\nHigher tier arena requries more accuracy and so in this build Eagle-Eye was chosen, however Fearsome Presence offers more utility and increases the stun chance on her A1, A3 and the stun set and is also a viable option.",

As long as her speed is tuned to the rest of the team and she always goes first before the nuker, maximise the accuracy in your build.\n\nYou can tune your arena speed team using any of the external tools, e.g. on deadwoodjedi.\n\nGlove: DEF%/HP%\nChest: Accuracy\nBoots: Speed\nRing: Any\nAmulet: Any with Accuracy\nBanner: Accuracy with Speed substats\n",

She allows the team's buffs to expire faster before the boss has a chance to do buff/debuff swap. The ATK down on the boss that she provides is absolutely critical. More turns means more control! Be careful with wave 2. Controlling the Valkyries is important. It's not the end of the world if one of them goes off, but the raw damage from the hit is pretty high. Don't use any buffs while Valkyries are alive if it can be avoided - you see Golden Reaper's speed boost not being used.\n \nWithout a DEF down, the race to kill the boss before the health swap cooldown gets even more intense. On the very first attack, use only Golden Reaper's A2 to decrease ATK - the boss is going to steal everything. At Golden Reaper's speed, it's possible to cycle through a few turns which is crucial when her A1 can reset all my champ's skills. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/a8PoHncrG0A ",

The support tree helps her with this.\n\nSince the attack tree does not do much for her in arena, the defense tree is probably the most viable option for her. Her passive can synergize pretty well with masteries such as wisdom of battle, because they can give bonuses to compensate for her passive which can cast fear or her. For t5 masteries, the counter attack mastery (she can boost her TM or heal from it), and cycle of revenge (always more TM) were picked.\n\nThe t6 mastery Timely intervention is good for her to gain a lot of turn meter.

The safer way is to bring a hero with a Shield Set with her, and then use skytouched Shaman to cleanse the block cooldown/decrease attack.\n\nSkytouched can also be used against champions with a provocation debuff in gold 4. Usually, only the taunter is speed tuned with the TM booster, then there is a break def and a nuke. If you are outspeed, Skytouched can be used to cleanse the debuff as a backup plan.

She’s often seen as a “poor man’s Coldheart” as she can fill the same role in some dungeons while she’s much easier to acquire than her Void Dark Elves counterpart. In practice she’s quite different and can do a number of things Coldheart can’t do, including being a superb Arena Nuker which will be the subject of another guide.\n\nAll of her attacks have an innate 25% additional chance to Crit. Her A2 attack is a single hit that ignores 75% of the enemy defense, allowing heavy damage on high Def enemies while her A3 completely depletes the enemy's Turn Meter. Finally she has an All Battles aura for another 17% Crit Rate that can help your entire team. Her kit and Spirit affinity make her an excellent choice to take on the Fire Knight that is often one of the toughest dungeons to farm reliably on level 20.\n\nMASTERIES\n\nSoulbound Bowyer is a damage dealer and this means you will go down the Offensive tree with her. For Dungeons her Offense tree will look like a typical Clan Boss tree going into Warmaster as all of her skills hit once. You can take a number of useful damage bonuses along the way, the most important being Bring it Down and Heart of Glory (if everything goes fine she won't be attacked by waves and the Fire Knight won't take a turn)\n\nYou need Accuracy to land her Turn Meter deplete making Support a useful secondary tree even thought there aren't a lot of useful masteries there for someone who doesn't place buffs or debuffs. Cycle of Magic is nice to give her a small chance to use her stronger attacks more often and Lore of Steel bonus, while small, will help you if you use any stat bonus set.",

You have to find 38% Crit Rate spread in your substats and that shouldn't be hard for mid and late game players since you have 20% from your base stats and Masteries. You should then be able to put Crit Damage gloves on her for some heavy hitting. For chest you want %HP for dungeon to draw the enemies attention away from her.

One more important part of the FK lockout is the Decrease Speed debuff.  With no Coldheart in my Roster Soulbond has allowed me to finish the Arbiter quest and is still part of my regular Fire Knight team.

Currently she favours her A1 (which is AoE but deals little damage and has no control value) over any other skill when facing the horde of Spiderlings while she could fill the same role there and help turn-lock the big Spider. Keep that in mind before trying to use her there on auto.\n\nShe can be of great help on Faction War teams and will work there even in multiples up to and including the final 21st boss.",

[Anti Crowd Control] His passive will remove any stun, freeze, sleep, or provoke and boost his TM by 50%, which allows Foli to get a turn very quickly. This makes him an effective counter CC champion, against Tormin for example (his A3 block revive is particular useful here). Note that the passive has a cooldown.\n3. [Single Target] Foli has an extremely impressive single target damage capability, due to his 4 hit A1, 4 hit A2, and 2 hit A3, focusing a huge amount of damage on a single target if used. \n\nVideo showcase  – Speed Nuke Team: https://youtu.be/5twAxsba2Fg \n\nAs Foli A3 is a double hit, you should select a primary target wisely, even on auto. In the video, we show how: \n\nI.  [Auto Battle 1] two speed boosters (Siphi and Arbiter) boost TM and speed, Madame Serris strip buffs, and Foli uses A3 on auto with my direction to double tap Rotos (so his passive is overcome).\nII. [Battle 2-3] two speed boosters boost TM and speed, madame strip buffs, and Foli uses A3 on auto with the direction to double tap Sinesha (as she is a force champion and weak hit is possible).\n\nHowever, Foli is not without his issues and there are many challenges:\nA. His A3 damage is not one of the highest and high defence teams or shield teams will be able to mitigate his damage. Champions that are force, have high defence, or damage mitigation (e.g., Bulwark mastery or ally protect) will easily survive the A3 nuke.\nB.        Foli is extremely fragile without any significant survival capabilities, which means it is mostly a kill or be killed situation.

However, booking her A2 will give a much higher chance to place debuffs and increase the consistency of having the 5 debuffs required for her passive Provoke to trigger on the boss. Otherwise, your team needs to consistently place them.\n\nYou can build Kantra in the Defense and Support tree mastery. The most important T6 mastery to have on her for this build is Fearsome Presence to increase the chance to Provoke from her Passive from 75% to 80%. Some key masteries to have on her are the single target damage reduction masteries in Improved Parry and Delayed Death since the Magma Dragon will only perform single target attacks when provoked. \n\nIn the Support tree, the basic Accuracy masteries, Arcane Celerity to improve TM when debuffs expire, Lore of Steel for more stats, Sniper to improve debuff chance and Master Hexer to increase debuff duration.  \n",

If you use her as your leader, you can lower the high accuracy requirement for Hard DT from your entire team. Once you meet the accuracy requirement, you want to gear to be tanky  with as much HP, Def and Speed as possible. A good number to shoot for is about 35k+ HP, 4.5k+ Def, and 200+ Speed. \n\nIdeally, you want to speed tune your team for her to go last in your team’s rotation to allow everyone else to place debuffs so she can trigger her passive provoke on her turn. Artifact sets are very flexible on her. You can equip any artifact sets on her as long as you meet the stat requirement. The main stats for each artifact piece I would suggest are:\n\nGlove: Def %/ HP %\nChest: Accuracy (If Accuracy requirement cannot be met) otherwise, HP%/Def%\nBoots: Speed\nRing: HP/Def\nAmulet: HP/Def\nBanner: Accuracy\n\nKantra can work with almost any set in the game.

He can place Increase Attack buff, Boost Turn Meter, Heal and Revive all dead allies. This combination of support abilities is very valuable for progression and will carry your teams through all dungeon content, especially if you haven’t completed the Arbiter mission yet. He also does the same job as an Arbiter in Arena, although on a smaller scale. He has the required skill set including a Speed Aura in an Arena Speed Nuke team. Finally, he is a core champion for Undead Faction Wars. He is one of the few champions in this Faction that can revive dead allies which is valuable to 3 star FW stages on the road to Lydia.\n\nYou will want to book his cooldown abilities fully. A1 is optional and doesn't matter as much.\n\nFor masteries, the support and defense tree works well for Gorgorab. He can work with little or no skill masteries. However, if built fully the most important Mastery to get on Gorgorab is Timely Intervention on T6. This mastery is core for revivers and healers as they gain a large TM boost when allies drop below 20% HP. Alternative would be to get +50 Resistance if you need to hit certain thresholds, however it's a niche choice.\n\nSince Gorgorab doesn’t require accuracy, the support masteries to increase HP and healing are chosen. Rapid response increases his TM when his buffs expire, Lore of Steel provides more stats, Spirit haste helps with the gain speed when allies are dead, Lasting Gifts increases the buff duration. On the Defense tree, the standard damage mitigation masteries are selected for more survivability. Resurgent, Delay Death play the same role and Cycle of Revenge to gain TM when allies get crit are all relevant. ",

A 300 speed Gorgorab with no masteries is much better than a 150 speed Gorgorab with full masteries.\n\nThe Speed or Divine Speed sets are the best sets for him. Equip the pieces that have the most speed in each slot. The main stat of the pieces are less important than the speed substats. Always choose the piece with the most speed substat regardless of the main stat. However, the ideal build Gorgorab build should have high HP with a decent amount of Defense. The best main stats for him should be as follows:  \n\nGlove: HP %/Def %\nChest: HP %/Def %\nBoots: Speed\nRing: HP/Def\nAmulet: HP/Def\nBanner: HP/Def\n\nThe high Accuracy in the screenshot is a coincidence because the Chest and the Banner with the highest available speed substats had it. You can also select some pieces with Resistance main stats (Chest and Banner) to reach 200+ and resist most dungeon-20 debuffs.\n\nHaving refresh jewellery works well on Gorgorab for extra TM boosts, healing and revives.\n",

Slower than 264) \n4)        Mausoleum Mage (In Shield set, places Buffs)\n5)        Seer (Strip Buffs and nuke the wave)\n\nThis set-up is different from the usual dungeon speed runs with Prince Kymar where he is the slowest champion. Hard DT mobs are too fast and deal too much damage. Your team cannot afford to let the enemy take a turn and deal damage to you. \n\nThe Doom Tower strategy:\n1)        Start the run on Manual, Use Prince Kymar’s A1, then click auto. \n2)        Let your other champions do their thing and nuke the wave. \n3)        On the Next wave, leave it on auto. Prince Kymar will use his Reset and you should LOOK FOR THE ANIMATION ABOVE HIS HEAD. An animation will appear if the Refresh accessory procs and his reset ability does not go on cooldown. \n4)        If the animation does not appear, leave the run and try again until the refresh procs.\n5)        Let your other champions do their thing to nuke the wave again and he will have his reset available on the third wave and your team will nuke it again.\n\nThis team is NOT auto friendly. As the first champion in the rotation, Prince Kymar will use his Reset on auto. Manually use his A1 at the start of the round first. Reset until refresh procs.\n \nThis strategy works on all DT stages except Stages with Tormin, since he can freeze and revive and Valkyrie stages, since she will drop your TM from her passive. This comp still works on stages with Rotos and Siphi. He will not die but you can kill him with A1s.\n\nThe video below demonstrates an example of a run on Stage 109 Hard where the Refresh accessory proc.

His Aura provides accuracy in all content and may be useful for mid-game accounts. His A1 has three hits, making him a good candidate for Giant Slayer T6 mastery if you need extra damage on clan boss and in dungeons. It applies the HP burn debuff and provides some healing if the burn is present on the target.\n\nA2 features AOE provoke that has a 100% chance to land if the targets are already under HP burn. Furthermore, it places a Decrease Atk debuff and deals respectable amounts of damage.\n\nHis passive is what makes him an especially valuable asset. When hit, Drexthar has a chance to place a HP burn debuff on attacker. His resistance increases up to 50 depending on the number of enemies under HP burn.\n\nIt is especially important that the passive will work on any affinity of attackers. It's drawback is that the enemies need to actively target Drexthar. This can be used to your advantage on Spirit affinity enemies, especially in Spider Dungeon and Nether Spider in Doom Tower in the late game.\n\nThe masteries in the featured build include the usual suspects: Crit rate and crit damage, standard damage masteries in the offense tree that can benefit clan boss champions. If you are using Drexthar in clan boss you will want to select Giant Slayer as the final T6 Mastery for extra damage and healing (combo with lifesteal).\n\nIn the support tree Accuracy buffing masteries have been selected. Sniper is an especially important pick. It doesn't benefit the provocation on A2, but improves the placement of HP Burn on the passive. If you are struggling with accuracy you can select Eagle Eye as the final mastery instead of Giant Slayer.",

However in this case we have Vergis as a lone rider without support of his team, hence some modifications to his masteries needed to be made to solo Scarab. \n\nSince he is the solo source of damage, Grim Resolve was selected for T2 mastery due to him often dropping below 50% of his HP. Getting extra 5% damage can be crucial between failed or successful run. \n\nFor T3, Whirlwind of Death and Life Drinker add much needed speed and additional heals when Vergis drops below 50% so he can get over 50% HP quicker for him to trigger continues heal from his passive. \n\nT4 and T5 are standard picks to reach Warmaster. The reasoning behind Warmaster instead of Helm Smasher is due to the fact that with Warmaster Vergis can be slotted into Dungeons or even Faction Wars and along with providing support be a decent source of damage vs very high HP opponents. \n\nIn Doom Tower Warmaster really only kicks in as a good source of damage once Scarabs shield is broken. As for the support tree, since he doesnt need any accuracy nor provides any heals, skills that augment his stats and allow him to gain turn meter faster were selected with addition of Lasting Gifts as T5 mastery to extend any buffs that he casts on himself or allies.\n\nAs you can see, one T5 mastery is missing, it is less relevant but either Kill Streak or Spirit Haste can be selected, both will provide roughly equal bonuses in terms of benefit.",

Extra heal on each turn will go a long way to help with sustain plus additional stats into the HP pool will help make Vergis tankier and harder to kill. \n\nDestroy set is a must due to mechanics of the Scarab King, you really want to decrease his overall HP and remove the shield as fast as possible or you might run into the danger of turn limit and not finish the instance.\n\nAs for stats, the key is to have a good balance between HP and DEF, here it is advisable to run Vergis as close as possible to ~50k HP and ~4k DEF. However the most important stat is resistance which should be at least 330, preferably 340+.\n\nThis will allow you do brush off any debuffs that waves and the Boss himself can throw at your Vergis. Due to strong affinity advantage, there is not need to crit cap your Vergis, however as a general practice it is advisable to have him at 100% or as close as possible. \n\nIn terms of speed, somewhere around 200 speed is more than ok, keep in mind that you will gain additional 18 speed from Whirlwind of Death and if you chose to have Spirit Haste from your support tree and stuck in 4 pieces of food, Vergis further will gain another 24 speed. So starting speed from the artifacts can be as low as ~160. \n\nDue to the fact that wave one has 3 War Chiefs, if your Vergis hits too hard, his passive wont be able to keep up with return damage + additional damage from the mobs abilities and your run will fail. When it comes to crit damage, after some testing it is advisable to have somewhere from 110-135, assuming that you have roughly 4k defence, otherwise numbers can change. \n\nGlove: Crit Rate %\nChest: Def%\nBoots: Speed\nRing: Def\nAmulet: Def\nBanner: Resistance\n",

Did we mention she has one of the highest base speed in the game and is faster than Arbiter?\n\nThe most important mastery for this build is T6 Timely Intervention (TI) for as many turn meter boosts as possible. You want her to place block debuffs, boost speed, and potentially revive someone if you suffer a setup (either at the start from an enemy Hegemon, or in later turns). Lasting gifts and Merciful Aid are natural pathways to TI that work well with Siphi's buffs and heals. Lore of Steel is needed to improve her speed.\n\nDefence tree wise, Blastproof mastery is useful for arena given the prevalance of aoe nukers, and cycle of revenge (CoR) works really well with TI",

Her Defence up is also useful for defence champions (e.g. Valk or your own Tormin). She really shines if the enemy survive more than two turns, because she can apply sleep without accuracy on her A1 (and it hits hard). She can also revive champions with full TM, so they are good to go. Her revive also gives a useful attack up buff, which is great because often it is the attack champion that dies during arena battles and when it is revived with full TM they can nuke the opposing team.\n\nDefence (top20 plat - early 2021):\n\nhttps://youtu.be/1kkVvFOZEbA\n\nSiphi on defence pairs well with warlord. To ensure she goes before enemy nukers, we use Tormin and Valkyrie to slow enemy TM and force them to bring either full immunity gear or a Siphi/Duchess in their team. \n\nOther pairings:\n- Siphi also pairs well with Rotos (multiples if you like), so some defences or offences will still use Rotos (in particular to counter hegemon), but it doesn’t have the power it used to.\n- Siphi pairs well with Valkyrie, as her Defence up empowers much stronger shields\n- Siphi aura is effective for high resist defence teams\n- Siphi passive is excellent for high HP champions, and provides a soft counter against freeze and fear teams\n\nWeaknesses:\n- Void affinity means she doesn't benefit from weak hits especially from magic affinity nukers, e.g. Trunda",

She is a farmable champion from campaign and a rare, meaning everyone should have early access to her. \n\nAs a mid game player as you progress in the dungeons you will find that the waves of enemies are getting far more health and defence than you can handle. AOE Decrease Defence on a low cooldown is one of the most important roles to make your runs faster and safer. An added benefit for both PVE and Arena is that champions that scale with Defence stat hit much lower under the Decrease Defence debuff. If you are not lucky to have amazing legendaries that have this skill, Warmaiden has your back!\n\nHer skills are great, and they determine her mastery choices:\n\n•        A3: Attacks all enemies and has 100% chance (when booked) of landing big version 60% [Decrease Defence]. There are only  3 rare champions that can do this, and only 2-3 in the game that are force affinity. So from an affinity and early access perspective, Warmaiden is second to none. Watch out only for Spirit affinity content where her ability may have weak hits and fail.\n•        She also self buffs with 50% attack up and has a minor 2.5% poison on A1, that make her excellent for early game spider and early clan boss.\n\nIt is worth noting that it is very viable to use her without any or very little masteries (Basic accuracy, crit rate, crit damage) as you are getting her to be your defence down and not main damage source. However, you must book her A3. She can also function decently at levels 40 and 50 if you do not want to max her fully and prefer to spend your resources on the main DPS.\n\nHer masteries can be the following for PvE bosses: Her primary role is to land decrease defence, because that boosts everyone’s subsequent damage. Therefore, you should ensure she has enough accuracy. After that the most utilitarian mastery tree is Warmaster, with support tree up to to master hexer.\n",

She is very strong against magic (blue) and force (red) affinity, but she can weak hit causing her to not land defence down against spirit (green) affinity.

Booking his A1 is not necessary as it doesn’t provide any benefit for this build, but it is nice for more damage. \n\nBig’Un’s Mastery for Doom Tower will be different than the standard nuke in Arena for example (you would be using Helmsmasher in that case). Some key masteries for this build are the basic accuracy masteries, Arcane Celerity to gain extra Turn Meter (TM) from Debuffs expiring, Evil Eye to decrease TM, and Lore of Steel for more stats.

It is better manual the stage to use your skills at the appropriate time and save your revive for the last moment during the boss stage to get that 3 star if you have to clear it for the first time.    \n\nhttps://youtu.be/6qWk2pCUri0",

Even though she is weak affinity, she is still very strong there. Her triple hit A1 can help bring down the shields and once the shield is down she can permanently keep the Fire Knight’s Turn Meter down. Furthermore, with the release of Doom Tower, her use has expanded once again. She is one of the top champions to use against the bosses Agreth the Nether Spider and Borgoth the Scarab King to control their TM and take them down before they get a turn.\n\nHowever, she will not help you with dealing with the waves or killing the boss. You will still need your other champions in the team to do that. She is also very vulnerable to dying so, it is advisable to have a healer and/or reviver in your team because if Alure dies, it is very likely that the run will fail. This guide will showcase Alure in Fire Knight 20, Agreth in Hard DT Stage 90, and Borgoth in Hard DT Stage 100.\n\nAlure is very cheap to build because you do not need to book her at all and masteries are not required. It is actually advisable not to book her since lowering the cooldown on her other skills means she uses her A1 less.\n\nAlthough you don’t need masteries, building masteries will definitely improve her performance. If you do decide to build her masteries, Offense and Support trees are suggested. The only mandatory mastery on the offence tree is Crit rate to help get her to 100%. On the support tree, you want to get accuracy, Lore of Steel for extra stats and Evil Eye for additional control. She doesn’t need any T5 or T6 mastery to do her job, although Giant Slayer for additional damage can be handy in faction wars or choose to use a lifesteal set on her for extra healing. \n\nThe below mastery is the only impactful mastery for her build so, you can save your energy with minimal farming on Minotaur for her masteries.\n",

You need her to be able to go faster than the enemies to lap them and keep their turn meter down. This is important since Alure is negative affinity to the Fire Knight so, she has a 35% chance to weak hit and weak hits will not crit and reduce TM. She needs to be fast enough to be able to go again before the Fire Knight takes a turn if you are unlucky with weak hits.\n\nFor Hard Doom Tower, the Highest level of Agreth and Borgoth (Stage 90 and 100) have a resistance of 330 so, you will need to build your Alure with at least that much accuracy. Speed is much more important here and I recommend at least 225+ speed. \n\nThe other stat you want to build on her is HP%. You need her to have as high HP as possible so she can survive.

Decrease Attack also helps in that regard. The alternative would be to use lifesteal on Alure with Giant Slayer.\n\nNote how it's easier to control the TM of the boss due to the Decrease Speed debuff from Scyl and Stag Knight.

At least one of your Coldhearts really needs to be in a Destroy set when she uses her heartseeker at the highest levels of Scarab Boss if you want the fight to be fast. This ensures that you can break the shell of Scarab.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Ew4rFOmb8eU\n\nThe video demonstrates a FK 20 run where she is the only TM control champion and she single-handedly kept the Fire Knight’s TM down the entire fight. Alure is very vulnerable to dying so it is advisable to have a healer like Aporthecary and a reviver like Gorgorab as shown in the video to support the team.

His A2 ability only attacks one enemy and places HP burn on all enemies if the condition of having at least 3 buffs/debuffs on the enemy is met. This placement of HP Burn on all enemies does not actually hit the enemies, so a weak hit and fails cannot happen. His A3 places irresistible Fear Debuff on all enemies granting additional CC against all the spiderlings. Additionally, Elder Skaarg is very cheap to build as he does not need books or masteries to perform his job.\n\nWhile it might look like Elder Skaarg can be used for the Frost Spider, it is not actually the case. He is not ideal because the Frost Spider has insanely high resistance of 500+ and the ability to prevent, remove, and transfer debuffs from itself making the requirement of having at least 3 debuffs on it to AOE HP Burn quite difficult. It is not recommended to use him for the Frost Spider. \n\nAs mentioned, Masteries are not important at all on Elder Skaarg so you can save your energy or gems on other things.

For the Offence tree,  the T6 Giant Slayer is the pick because she has lots of multi-hit abilities. Standard Crit Rate, Crit Damage and damage dealing masteries are picked as well. In the Support tree the Accuracy masteries, Lore of Steel for Stats, Evil Eye to decrease TM, Sniper for added chance to place Poison are chosen along with Master Hexer to extend the Poison debuffs.\n \nArcane Celerity is great for dungeon content as she places lots of debuffs and can gain a lot of TM when they expire. However, if you plan to permanently use Zavia in CB, Arcane Celerity is to be avoided as it can mess with your Clan Boss speed tune (Unkillable and Counterattack comps). In fact, it is suggested to avoid the support tree entirely and pick the Defense secondary tree instead for NM and UNM cb. Zavia has very low base defense and the damage mitigation provided in the Defense tree helps her survive longer in the Clan Boss.\n\nIf you plan to permanently use Zavia in the Arena, Helmsmasher is advised instead for Giant Slayer for T6 as it provides the best first hit DPS.

Any combination of sets can work as long as you have the stats.\n\nFor Arena, a combination of Savage and Cruel is ideal. 100% Crit Rate, as high Attack and Crit Damage as possible with enough speed to match your arena team. She should be tuned to go after your Def Down champion. Accuracy is not important since Poison is not a big factor in Arena and Block Revive does not require accuracy.\n\nFor Doom Tower, follow the same build for dungeon but a minimum accuracy of 330 required Hard DT Bosses.\n\nGlove: Crit Rate / Crit Damage \nChest: ATK % \nBoots: Speed \nRing: Attack\nAmulet: Crit Damage \nBanner: Accuracy\n\nThe build shown in the screenshot is primarily used for Dungeon and Doom Tower content.

This guide will focus on her role in a Clan Boss team, while the following guides will feature her in other content with a somewhat different build and equipment.\n\nShe is worth booking if you're using her extensively as it adds a considerable amount of dps.\n\nZavia’s AI has recently been changed to make her one of the best Poisoner DPS champion for Clan Boss. \n\nAll her abilities can place multiple 5% poisons and are multi-hitters. Paired with a champion that can place an AOE Counterattack buff, she can singlehandedly keep the CB debuff full of poison and deal tons of damage through the Giant Slayer mastery. \n\nThe only drawback to Zavia is her low Base Defense. In order to use her effectively in Clan Boss, you must focus her build entirely on defense. Completely ignore Attack, Crit Rate, and Crit Damage unless you can afford to. An exception from this can be made if you run her in an Unkillable team. Then you can build her for damage, including Ignore Defence sets. \n\nIn terms of masteries the best T6 mastery for her is the Giant Slayer. It synergizes well with Lifesteal keeping her at full health throughout most of the fight. It is important not to pick any turn meter boosting masteries in order not to mess up the turn order if you're running her in such a team.",

Some key masteries for him are the basic the accuracy masteries, Evil Eye to decrease TM, and Lore of Steel for more stats. \n\nHowever, this build uses Arcane Celerity to gain TM from Debuffs expiring.

If you are using him as your primary/first CC champion, you will need to build him with at least 265 speed, which is not recommended. Nethril has a very low base speed which makes it a little difficult to build him with that much speed. Use another champion to CC first like a Psylar and Nethril to follow up with his CC ability. \n\nA combination of Speed, Accuracy, Perception set to meet the accuracy requirement and have at least 220+ speed is recommended. There are other optional improvements for sets you can make if you can reach the recommended stats such as Reflex Set and Relentless sets if you have them as well as jewelery with refresh abilities from the Bazaar.\n\nRecommended main stats:\nGlove: Def %/ HP %\nChest: Accuracy (If Accuracy requirement cannot be met) otherwise, HP%/Def%\nBoots: Speed\nRing: HP/Def\nAmulet: HP/Def\nBanner: Accuracy\n \nAdvice: Consider taking your fastest piece of speed gear, usually from your Arbiter or speed booster, and your highest accuracy piece from your other champions so you can meet the speed and accuracy requirement.

You can then focus your DPS on the target that is not stunned or is the priority target.\n\nFor the Hard CC strategy Nethril is paired with Psylar and Big’Un. Nethril cannot function as your only CC champion, your team needs to have at least 2, ideally 3 CC champions to continuously lock down the enemy waves in this strategy. The following team is used to clear most of the Hard DT waves (Guides on the other champions will also be available):\n\nPsylar: 1st CC champion. Fastest, goes first so other champion can take a turn.\nNethril: 2nd CC champion\nBig’Un: 3rd CC champion. Secondary DPS.\nLydia/Venus: Debuffer\nRotos: Main DPS \n\nThe video below demonstrates a run on one of the toughest stage in Hard DT (112) which has multiple Tormins. This team only suffers in DT when facing against Siphi with a passive that cleanses the stuns and debuffs from Rotos (they're also negative affinity for Nethril)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/oSSn0fsKRd8 \n\nVenus here was used because of Tormin. Tormin will freeze the team if Lydia places her buffs. Lydia is used when there’s no Tormin. This role can be replaced with any Decrease Def champion you have. \n\nThe run has to be done manually and some decision making has to be done throughout the run (I.E Don't waste the stun ability when all the enemies are already stunned. Don't waste the AOE TM decrease when the enemies are already on low TM. Focus on the enemies that are not stunned/have high TM with Evil Eye Procs. Focus DPS on the priority targets).\n",

Dracomorph has skills that combine Decrease Defence, Weaken, Poisons and damage based on the number of debuffs all in one unit. This makes him one of the best CB champions for damage.\n\nThe masteries are picked with maximum DPS in mind as Unkillable (UK) allows to ignore defence in favour of offense.

      "desc": "There are multiple ways of building a Counterattack CB team with Dracomorph depending on your available champions. Let's make a brief overview of the options.\n\nIf you are seeking one key UNM compositions you will likely need to go the White Whale route - the combination of a persistent Speed Buff with CA is an example. \n\nSee for example: https://www.deadwoodjedi.com/speed-tunes-4/White-Whale---Ma'Shalled-v2\n\nIf you don't have the champions for those kind of comps you still have multiple options for 2 key UNM and 1 key NM. \n\nOne such option is the double CA composition. It can work with any of such champions, however Valkyrie and Skullcrusher is one of the stronger variations and works well enough to reliably 2 key UNM on any affinity on auto.\n\nIt relies on Valkyrie shields for CB stun and AOE 1 and Skullcrusher Ally protection and Unkillable for tanking AOE 2. If built with the right parameters it will last for 40-50 turns on UNM Clan Boss. However, it does require a good DPS champion that is going to be dealing the bulk of Poison damage and the composition needs the Def Down and Weaken debuffs to reach the required damage levels.\n\nDracomorph fits this role perfectly and is supported by the rest of the cast. This is not a perfectly tuned composition as this Valkyrie spends part of her time on the Scarab and Arena and is not tuned. Keep in mind that her passive causes tuning problems on affinity bosses due to TM boosts anyway. \n\nYou can see the Void UNM CB run below:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/FRo09T6_-Jg \n\nSpeed:\n    \nValkyrie 249 (not tuned)\nSepulcher Sentinel 239 \nDracomorph 182\nVizier 177\nSkullcrusher 173\n\nThe first turns are not as important for this the team. Synchronization at turns 30-50 is what matter most as one mistake, lack of the correct buffs or a crit from CB can spell the end of your run. First few turns can be run on manual to prevent Vizier from placing unwanted debuffs for extra dps.\n\nDracomorph can also be tuned specifically for other PVE content including all dungeons, featured on the following pages.",

Dracomorph can help with this.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znDFnGY4OSI\n\nIn the video above you can see a speed run with Arbiter, Dracomorph, 2 RG and renegade. Arbiter buffs Atk, TM boosts. Dracomorph places the DEF Down, weaken. Royal guards use takedown, clear the wave. Renegade refreshes the skills, the cycle repeats. If built correctly this team can be fast, efficent and safe.\n\nLet's have a look at Dracomorph in the other dungeons and content on the next page.",

The CB was on Magic and the combination of weak hits and decrease accuracy made it difficult for Fayne to place her debuffs early in the fight. As you can see, she is still very squishy even when built defensively with ally protection and died very early in the fight but with Vizier in the team, her debuffs still persist throughout the fight.

He has a high chance of placing the Leech Debuff on his A1, can place Decrease Attack as a backup, and provide some heal through Continuous heal buffs. \n\nHe is also Def based making it easier to build him to survive and he has good multipliers to deal damage. His Leech debuff and continuous heal buffs lessens the burden of requiring to build 5 different champions in Lifesteal gear as it is enough to heal your team. You should then be able to build your champions with better stats with better sets. His Leech is also unique it that he places it before attacking which means that it cannot weak hit allowing him to be used in all affinity. \n\nThe video below shows an example of a Standard Mid-game Budget Clan Boss team with 4 epics and the legendary fusion Rhazin.

He can hit extremely hard when fully booked and is viable in a wide variety of late game content.\n\nA big portion of his power comes from “RNG” extra turns (passive), and his partial ignore defence A3 ability. Rotos is a hard-hitting single target nuker and can severely damage key members of an unbuffed/unprotected enemy team in Arena – because Rotos can cut in attack sequences, e.g. from Hegemons that sit tightly in the Platinum arena spots.\n\nMastery wise, Rotos works best when he's maximising damage output. For a Late Game+ dps champion on Arena with more than 100% Crit Rate and 220+ Crit Damage the final T6 mastery Helmsmasher for ignoring defence provides the best results. In the defence tree Retribution is important for opportunity of extra turns on A1. \n\nLet’s go through the other key masteries:\n\n•        We picked shield breaker early on over Heart of Glory or Grim Resolve because Rotos is neither likely to be at full HP (often not a go first team), nor likely to be below 50% HP often (see passive)\n•        Ruthless ambush and Singled Out and Bring it Down for killing targets that are heavily injured and on first hit and those with higher HP\n•        Cycle of Violence is really important as Rotos will trigger this often, bringing his devastating A2 and A3 around that have short cooldowns\n•        Blood Shield and Kill Streak were selected, but Methodical and Stoked to Fury are also viable option\n\nIf you are using Rotos you might want to fully book him as the damage and cooldowns are significantly improved in that scenario",

Rotos needs to have high damage (5k+ attack, 240%+ cd) and doesn’t have to be that fast (because he can cut in with attacks of opportunity due to passive). His Accuracy is not particularly important in arena, because you should have other sources of defence down (or none needed at all against soft targets).\n\nYou are looking for items with Crit Rate, Crit Damage and Atk% substats in particular.\n\nGlove: Crit Damage \nChest: Attack%/Resist, \nBoots: Speed/Attack%\nRing: Attack                        Att% and HP% substat\nAmulet: Crit Damage          Att and resist substat\nBanner: Att/Resist              Att% substat \n\nAny cooldown reset accessory is extremely favourable and will increase the power of Rotos considerably.

For example, you can drop 20-30 speed for attack boots (+500 attack) or resist chest + banner (+190 resist). There are many ways to make Rotos work for different purposes.\n",

Despite this, she does have a higher damage potential than Frozen Banshee, has better utility, as well as better base stats.\n\nWhat is absolutely essential? Accuracy first and foremost, since all of her skills require accuracy to land her debuffs. The featured Narma has 310 Accuracy which is significantly higher than required for UNM CB simply because she is used in the Doom Tower to farm the Magma Dragon. 220 Accuracy will suffice if you choose to use her for only CB and dungeons. \n\nHigh HP is also necessary if you want to maximize her healing potential. At over 61k HP she can drop some very nice heals and reduce the need for lifesteal gear on other clan boss champions in the comp.\n\nDefense is important if you're not running an Unkillable CB comp, and high Crit rate, Crit damage, and attack to boost her dps. Just a note that she only has ~70% crit rate in this build because a 30% Crit Rate Buff is available from Lanakis. If you do not use champions that provide it, aim for 100% Crit rate. \n\nThe sets you choose aren't as important. If you're struggling to keep her alive you can run her in Stalwart or Lifesteal sets. Refresh accessories can be extremely helpful.\n\nGlove: DEF %\nChest: HP %\nBoots: Speed \nRing: DEF\nAmulet: Crit Damage\nBanner: Attack / Accuracy\n\nAccessories are a great place to freely adjust her stats based on your individual needs. This build used a DEF ring with HP % subs, a Crit damage amulet and an Attack banner.",

      "desc": "Arena can be a tough area to excel in and it’s vital for progression both in missions and in great hall. The tiers also provide stat bonuses in all the areas of the game. If you’re struggling in early game and you want to git gud, this guide will help you chart a plan on how to progress properly. This page will focus on early game that is defined as having your starter or campaign farmer solo 12-3 brutal. In arena terms it’s progressing from Bronze to Silver tier.\n \nYou should be able to reach Silver and we will showcase a recently started 7-day old account that does exactly that.\n \nRaid is a turn-based game, and going first gives a huge advantage in arena especially in early game where champion defence tends to be low. To determine which team goes first, Raid introduces the concept of a “turn meter” race. Without going into the complex details the general speed attack team sequence is:\n\nBe Fast: Use 1, and commonly 2 speed boosters to go first for your whole team. This means the first 1-2 champions boosts the speed of your whole team, allowing you to equip powerful slow attack champions to do the real damage and not allowing the enemy to respond!\n\nAtk Up: this step is optional. It helps your main attacker, but step 3 is more important\n\nDefence Down on Enemy Team: Set your nuker to succeed by reducing enemy defence (all enemies).\n\nNuke:  Use 1 AOE attack to kill all or most enemies, making them unable to recover. Moves 1-3 are simply there to set-up for the final nuke.\n \nShort FAQ: \n• You may ask, why not just use 4 attack champions?  Because to get them to go all first, they have to be incredibly fast and will not do much damage, and if they don’t go first then the enemy will kill them easily.\n• Is 1 nuker enough?  Absolutely yes if equipped with correct gear (see next slide).\n• How fast do my 2 speed boosters have to be?  This depends on your opponent and it is a continuous gear race even at top level.\n \nThere is a handy flowchart to help consolidate the main points below",

You must have focus on what you want each champion to achieve. Try not to gear them as multi-role champions and instead focus on a singular purpose (fastest champion, highest accuracy champion or hardest hitting champion). \n\nSpeed Aura and Primary Speed Lead (fastest champion): \nSpeed Boots, Speed sub-stats for all other gear. Do not care about primary and other stats. Use speed sets for bonus if possible, and Lore of Steel mastery\n\nSecondary Booster (second fastest, generally X% slower than 1., where X is the TM boost value from 1.):\nSpeed Boots, Speed sub-stats for all other gear, do not care about primary and other stats.

Use speed/accuracy/perception (craft in forge) sets for bonus and Lore of Steel mastery\n\nNuke AOE (slowest 1 speed below 3.):\n [Must be 100% crit rate or 75% crit rate for Starter champions like Kael] Speed Boots, Attack % Chest, Crit rate gloves. For Weapon, Helm, and Shield: use Crit rate, Crit damage, and Attack % sub-stats.\n \nForge and campaign are your best friends to get this equipment.

You have to play her on manual unfortunately. \nSpirithost provides the speed aura.\nWarmaiden provides the AOE Defence down.\nKael nukes. \n \nNote that the levels on everyone except Kael are low. The sequence of your turns and gear are much more important.\n \nNote that team power is meaningless from early to late game. You can see it in the victory screenshot below. Team power calculated by favouring resistance over anything else, and since it is irrelevant to both you speed boosters and your nuker, it is actually almost completely irrelevant as an indicator. Unless the enemy team has 300k+ power, indicating they are highly geared for defence, usually it has not meaningful whatsoever. \n \nDon’t worry about legendaries or epics. If you go first and kill everyone does it matter what champion border they have? The vast majority of legendaries in Bronze are not built or utilised correctly and can’t break the sequence of the speed team. Do read up their skills and learn from both your victories and your losses though.\n \nYou can see the video of attacks with an F2P team below\n \nhttps://youtu.be/JecPqfhxEUs\n \nAs you can see, the point was to show all battles without picking them. Many legendaries just fell easily to the team. Rotos was an exception however and had wiped out our team instead. Note for the future: avoid unless you know how to deal with his passive. The rest of the teams demonstrate how the results may vary. Refresh often and you will be in silver after you learn to pick your fights.\n \nMatchmaking below gold tier takes into account your total player power and your team. This means it’s much more beneficial to follow the early game guide and focus on just a few champions rather than gearing and levelling a whole squad to 50 that you’re not going to use. Pick who will be your core champions in the mid game carefully and check out the mid game arena guide for silver tier action (WIP)",

His A1 hits hard and Fu-Shan has a 25% chance to perform his A1 again that stacks continuously allowing him to use A1 on a target multiple times if you’re lucky.

This means that when you have equipment that may have bad main stats (e.g. gloves with flat hp) but good substat procs in speed you keep those items around and put them on your main speed booster.\n\nThis is especially true for 5 star gear and above as their speed substats become a significant source of additional speed. Speed mainstat boots are non-negotiable (5 star wanted for early game) and speed substats on all other pieces. You can farm that gear in brutal campaign.\n\nThe Speed set with 12% bonus is best in slot, but in this example random pieces with high speed rolls were used because the speed sets did not have enough speed substats. \n\nAccuracy is secondary, don't sacrifice Speed to get it. Perception sets can be helpful too, but it's best to use them on your Decrease DEF champion, in this Arena composition - Warmaiden. Accuracy is way more important for her role.\n\nRule of a thumb: \n\nIf a Speed set (2 pieces) has no speed substats, 2 Random set pieces that add up to 13 speed substats or more are better than the pure Speed set. \n\nThat can change for other champs with higher/lower basespeed.",

Sepulcher is running at a 4:3 to block the stun every time. Kreela is also running 4:3 to permanently give the team Increase Crit Rate Buff and perform ally attack when Dec Def/Weaken are placed to maximize damage. Rhazin provides the Dec Def/Weaken and secondary DPS. Skullcrusher with the team Counterattack and Ally Protection buff. \n\nWith Turvold at 106 speed, he is running at 2:3, meaning he takes 2 turns for every 3 CB turns. In this team, he only takes a turn before AOE1 and after AOE2. He does not take a turn between AOE1 and AOE2. This means that he will have all the defensive buffs (Increase Def, Block Debuff, CA, Ally Protect) permanently allowing him to survive with only 2.5k-3k Def. His Extra turn skill is timed to be used before any buffs are placed so he doesn’t lose any buffs and his A3 Juggernaut is also timed to be used when he has the greatest number of buffs(7) on him for maximum damage.\n\nThis team unfortunately only works on UNM and as with any CA team, works on all affinities except Spirit due to the slow debuff.\n\nThe video below showcases the run as well as the manual set up for this team comfortably 2-keying UNM CB.

He is immune to all hard CC (Stun, Freeze, and Sleep) and provides a team wide damage reduction. \n\nTo put his damage reduction into perspective Stalwart set is an amazing set that provides 30% damage reduction from AOE attacks but is a 4-piece set. Norog’s passive provides half of this effect (15%) at worst case for ANY attacks, not just AOE. Best case scenario it’s slightly less damage reduction for ANY attacks for the team (25%). Since most of his utility is in his passive, he does not require any books at all to be effective making him cheap to build on a budget.\n\nHe is a great champion for Ice Golem, a Solid CB Champion if you’re still lacking the end-game CB champions, and is one of the best for Skinwalkers Faction Wars. With the release of the two new Doom Tower Bosses, Eternal Dragon and Celestial Griffin his passive fits perfectly as a great option for those bosses.\n\nMasteries on this Norog build are fairly simple. Since his debuffs are irrelevant, we will take the Offense and Defense Tree. In the Offense Tree, the standard Clan Boss damage dealing masteries are chosen.

He is a perfect champion to fit your broken gear pieces that have amazing substats. \n\nGlove: Crit Rate / Crit Damage\nChest: Def %\nBoots: Def % / Speed\nRing: Def\nAmulet: Crit Damage\nBanner: Def\n\nThe Norog build shown here is used in a speed tuned Clan Boss team, hence the 172 speed in Lifesteal. This exact build can be used in any other content but if you are not using him in CB, having more speed, 200+ is recommended, and he will perform much better.

On Void, put him in the lead position so the CB will target him. Affinities will be more complex;\n\n1)        Force – The easiest to set up since Norog is weak affinity. You can position Norog anywhere, but he must go before any other Magic champion you have in your team.  eg. if you have a FB, Norog should be positioned before her so the CB will target Norog first (Norog at a slot 2, FB at slot 4). This means that you do not have to put Norog in the lead. If you have champions of other affinities with an aura, you can use them as lead. \n\nThis is the how positioning is prioritized:\n\n4th 2nd\n               1st (Lead)\n5th 3rd\n\n2)        Magic – You must not have any Spirit champion in your team as the Magic CB will always target it. Without a Spirit champion, you can position Norog after your Force champions since CB will not target Force champions. If you have a Force champion like Sepulcher Sentinel, you can use her as lead and put Norog in the other slots (You must still follow the same concept as Force above if you have other Magic champions in your team).  \n\n3)        Spirit – Norog cannot be the stun target for Spirit because he is a positive affinity there and a standard CA team usually don’t work in Spirit anyway due to the slow debuff.\n\nThis is an example of a Late game CB team built to use Norog as the stun target.\n1)        Norog (172)\n2)        Skullcrusher (171)\n3)        Rhazin (176)\n4)        Godseeker Aniri (172)\n5)        Sepulcher (227)\n\nThis team works on UNM and NM, all affinity except Spirit. This video shows this team running on UNM and NM. The UNM run unfortunately ended early due to missing ATK down but was still able to 3 key and the NM run comfortably 1 key. You can reach 2 key territory with Norog if that is your goal.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/NcNeUl764c4\n\nThe following pages will showcase Norog in dungeons and Doom Tower",

Norog is definitely one of the best options for this faction in Faction Wars. \n\nSince this faction does not currently have any revivers, it is very important to survive and not to let your champions kick the bucket to get the 3* completion. Norog’s passive damage reduction helps with that. The FW21 boss here is the one that swaps buffs, leaving your team without any buffs, hence triggering the bigger (25%) damage reduction from Norog’s passive. He is also a solid damage dealer, which is needed since this boss swaps health and you need to take down the bosses before he can swap health again.\n\nThis video shows a Skinwalker 21 stage done on auto, but if you need to complete this stage for the first time, you should consider running this stage on manual and time placing Fayne’s debuffs after the boss uses the transfers Debuffs skill. Having all the Debuffs from Fayne transferred back to your team may cause your team to take too much damage and wipe before clearing.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC-uJOvT8E4&t=13m42s\n",

This guide will cover her in Platinum Arena, all dungeons, Faction Wars, Doom Tower and Clan Boss.\n\nBooking her A2 and A3 for decreased cooldowns to take advantage of the Buffs she provides and the mass revive is needed. Her A1 shield does not provide much benefit when booked so if you were able to get the upgrades for her other skills don't spend extra books.\n\nHer A2 provides three important buffs: Block Debuffs that helps against a variety or threats. ATK Up that can help your damage dealers and Perfect Veil that hides the rest of the team and reduces incoming AOE damage by 15% synergizing well with Duchess passive that further reduces AOE damage by 25% (15% vs bosses).\n\nIn terms of masteries Lilitu is relatively easy to build. She needs as much survivability as possible in a standard build. Her T6 mastery choice will depend on how you're planning to use her.\n\nIf you are using her for Clan Boss you will want to pick Warmaster as the T6 mastery. This will be the discussed in the respective CB build further down the line.\n\nIf you are using Lilitu to break into top Platinum you might want to use a specialised build with Timely Intervention and a Swift Parry set ignoring stacking the Resistance and opting for more speed, HP/DEF. This is a new variation and not covered here.\n\nOutside of those cases the golden standard for Lilitu for a long time has been to stack her with 600+ Resistance for Platinum Arena and use her everywhere. This will be the main showcase build that still works for a majority of players.\n\nIn this build Unshakable is selected as the T6 mastery for +50 Resistance. Masteries that increase the chances to survive are all selected in the Support and the Defence trees. This allows Lilitu to become one of the tankiest champions for all content and provides a lifeline to your team even if they are fully wiped.",

She is the grindy champion that makes your team survive thanks to her kit. Her Block Debuffs allows the team to avoid Tormin freeze.

She can synergise extremely well with Candraphone, Mortu, Rotos and many other heavy damage dealers. Candraphone specifically can be a monster with her and the permanent Perfect Veil can help him hit extremely hard as shown in the video below.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/6jUZbrdFBbs\n\nWe will be covering Lilitu in the dungeons on the next page",

She benefits  from being able to take multiple turns as she passively heals and provides Increase Speed buffs to your team as well as lowers her cooldown.\n\nHowever, the stats are still important. Relentless set are hard to come by. Do not build her in Relentless set if you cannot achieve the required stats. She can work just as well with pure Speed, Perception, Resistance sets or even random items as long as you meet the required stats.\n\nGlove: Def %\nChest: Resistance\nBoots: Speed\nRing: Defense\nAmulet: Defense\nBanner: Resistance\n",

Her passive heals and cleanses random debuffs on all allies every time she takes a turn. It turns out that cleansing a random debuffs from all allies every turn is an incredibly useful ability to have in a team as it helps negate the core mechanic of almost all the bosses in the game. \n\nThis guide will feature Doompriest in different areas of the game. Her main role in the team is always to cleanse and heal your team, so anywhere a constant cleanse is required, she will be useful. This includes Ice Golem, Dragon, Faction wars, Clan Boss, and most of the Doom Tower Bosses.\n\nMasteries are actually not important for Doompriest but can definitely improve her performance if you decide to invest in her. Masteries on Doompriest are straightforward. Take the Offense and Defense Tree. In the Offense Tree, the PVE damage dealing masteries are chosen. Crit Rate, Crit Damage and all the damage increasing masteries on the left down to Warmaster since she doesn’t really do much raw damage. \n\nIn the Defense Tree, take the Damage mitigation mastery in Tough Skin, Blastproof, Delayed Death to improve survivability into Cycle of Revenge for TM increase to take as many turns as possible.  \n\nNote that if you are using her for CB, avoid Cycle of Revenge and instead take the Counterattack masteries as the TM boost can break your speed tune. This is covered in the CB portion of the guide.",

Around 230+ speed with decent survivability, 3k+ DEF, 40k+ HP is recommended for Late Game+. \n\nOffensive stats do not matter as she does not do any damage. The best set to have on her is Relentless and Speed as her passive triggers every extra turn. Prioritize building the recommended stats on her. Do not build her in Relentless if you cannot achieve a decent number of recommended stats. Full Speed set is recommended if you cannot achieve the stats in Relentless.\n\nIf you are using her in a non-unkillable CB team, build her in Lifesteal instead. Keep the focus on the defensive stats for the CB level you are hitting (3k+ Def for NM, 4k+ Def for UNM) and the speed you need for your CB team. There are many types of CB teams where Doompriest can fit in. Generally her main role will be to cleanse the affinity debuff and stun the CB places on your team. To do that, she needs to be tuned to take her turn right after the CB so she can cleanse all the debuffs the CB places on your team immediately. This usually means she has to be fastest but it is not always the case. Always check your speed tune is a Clan Boss calculator to make sure she takes her turn right after the CB goes.\n\nGlove: HP%/Def%\nChest: HP%/Def%\nBoots: Speed\nRing: HP/Def\nAmulet: HP/Def\nBanner: HP/Def\n",

Although Venus has a AOE HP Burn herself, her AI will not use it as the spiderlings have counterattack. Doompriest is here for the same utility of providing constant heals and debuff removal. However, Doompriest only cleanses 1 debuff per turn and this Boss is notorious for placing tons of Poisons on your team.

He also provides Increase Defense, Ally Protection and passively puts up Continuous Heal. He also has decent Resistance to keep his skills as much as possible. Built in Stalwart to mitigate AoE Damage\n- Drexthar provides the damage needed to kill the boss with his HP Burn on A1 or from his passive application to ads.

The benefit of using Doompriest is that your speedtuned team will work on all affinities. A speed tuned team usually suffers when the CB affinity changes with stun targeting and the Decrease Speed debuff which breaks your speedtune during the Spirit affinity boss. The con of using Doompriest is that she doesn’t offer anything other than the debuff cleanse. She does very little damage and the heal she provides is minimal. Your CB damage will be lower than if you were to use another CB champion instead not counting the debuffs. \n\nThe video below shows an example of CB teams with Doompriest on NM and UNM. The first half shows a NM run on Spirit affinity. This a standard CA team that uses double ally protection in Skullcrusher and Tyrant Ixlimor. \n\nPeydma for Decrease Attack, \nFayne for Decrease Defense, Weaken, and Poison (Fayne is used here instead of Rhazin because of weak affinity. Rhazin constant weak hits will cause him to miss his debuff and lower the team’s damage output).\nFinally, Doompriest is core in this team to cleanse the Decrease Speed and Stun debuff. \n\nNormally, a standard speedtuned counterattack team will fail due to the decrease speed debuff, but this team is able to function normally because Doompriest is in the team. \n\nThe second half shows an UNM run on Magic affinity. The same team if used with Rhazin instead of Fayne. This team is almost capable of 2-keying UNM. If better CB champions were used like Altan instead of Peydma 2-key is definitely achievable.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/rnvccZhG5xk\n\nThere are some niche uses for Doompriest in Unkillable teams, but you have to look up the specific compositions and gear her differently for those purposes",

He is best known for his ability to provide a permanent Increase Speed buff to your team and enabling a variety of 2:1 Clan Boss teams dubbed the White Whale compositions. \n\nHowever, aside from his use in Clan Boss, he is also remarkably useful in all dungeon content. He provides team buffs, AOE control through True Fear, Healing through Leech and damage. Booking Ma’shalled can also be relatively cheap if you’re lucky as only his A2 needs to be booked and it only requires one book. This guide will focus on using Ma’shalled in Minotaur, Dragon, Fire Knight, Ice Golem, Arena and Faction Wars. The CB guide is covered separately due to specific speed and setup.\n\nMasteries for Ma’shalled can vary slightly depending on where he will be used. The masteries shown in this guide are specifically for Dungeon PVE and Clan Boss. For this build, the offense and defense tree are selected. \n\nIn the Offense tree, Crit rate, Crit Damage, and all the damage increasing masteries on the left down to T6 Warmaster.

He is not the best arena champion because he is not specialized as a nuker or debuffer. \n\nHe is a conditional nuker and a conditional CC champion. If you want him to nuke with his AOE, he needs to land his Leech on all enemies first, which means he needs accuracy. If you build him with accuracy, his damage stats will suffer and will most likely not do enough damage to nuke the enemies. Without accuracy, all his abilities are just single target hits with no added effect which makes him terrible for arena in Late Game+ setting and Platinum for example.\n\nOn the other hand, if you build him as a CC champion with high speed and accuracy another problem appears with his type of CC. True Fear only has a 50% chance to proc. This means that even if you land your True Fear on all enemies, you are still depending on RNG for the True Fear to proc. You may get unlucky, and the True Fear does absolutely nothing.\n\nIf you do decide to use him for Arena the following masteries are suggested: In the Offense tree Arena nuker masteries in Crit Rate, Crit Damage, Heart of Glory, Ruthless Ambush, down to T6 Helmsmasher (if you have 100% Crit Rate and over 220%+ Crit Damage). \n\nWe then take the Support tree for the accuracy masteries, and most importantly Evil Eye. Evil eye will proc the single target version on all enemies (20% TM reduction) on Ma'shalled.\n",

Apart from offering damage his A3, Oni’s Rage, includes Decrease Defense and Weaken debuffs that are crucial to all CB teams. This ability has a unique mechanic where every 4th use of this ability against a single target will deal a burst of 5 hits instead of 1, making this ability the highest single target damage ability in the game! His A2, Blood Freeze synergizes with it by lowering the CD on this ability on Clan Boss allowing for more use of his A3 throughout the fight. Outside of Clan Boss, his A2 steals 100% of the target’s turn meter that is useful against certain bosses and lets him cycle his turns quicker.  \n\nBooking Jintoro is necessary as he needs both of his skill cooldowns lowered. Additionally, Jintoro is all about dealing damage, so getting the damage increase from books matters for maximum Damage output.\n\nThis guide page will showcase Jintoro in a Counterattack team. If you unfortunately do not have the champions to build a good unkillable team, Jintoro is still perfectly usable as a DPS champion in a Standard non-unkillable Counter-attack team. \n\nMasteries on Jintoro will be the standard CB Masteries and the will remain the same across all builds. We will take the Offense and Defense tree. In the Offense tree, take Crit Rate, Crit Damage and all the CB damage increasing masteries on the left down to Warmaster. Life drinker is an important mastery to take for lifesteal when under 50% Health so Jintoro can lifesteal and enable the counterattack mastery on the Defense Tree. In the Defense Tree, take the Damage mitigation mastery in Tough Skin, Blastproof, Delayed Death, into both T5 counter attack masteries in Retribution and Deterrence.\n\nThis set of Masteries works for both Unkillable and Non-unkillable teams.\n",

She was very well received when she was first introduced into Raid she enabled many people to clear Faction Wars stage 21 for Dwarves (considered one of the hardest, and the only other reviver was Maulie, a legendary with only a single target revive)\n\nThis guide will mainly cover Faction Wars and dungeons 20 (Hard Doom Tower bosses will be covered later). In these showcases, slower teams (no Seer one shot team etc)  will be used so we can see her support capabilities.\n\nBooking her A2 and A3 for the cooldowns is needed for optimal results. Her A1 has a 75% chance to remove a random debuff from a random ally when booked is not game changing enough so if you could upgrade other skills without booking this, don't spend extra books. \n\nHer A2 places a 2 turn Continuous heal of 15% and a 2 turn shield equal to 20% of her max HP on a 3 turn cooldown when booked is what keeps the team alive. Her A3 revives 2 random allies with 20% HP and 20% TM, and places a 2 turn shield of 30% of their HP on a 5 turn cooldown is a very good safety net for contents such as FW.\n\nMelga is a support that doesn't deal massive damage so in term of masteries, we can go defense and support. Defense tree to maximize her survivability and Support tree to improve her healing (Healing masteries work with continuous heal). This mastery build is more PvE focused so Blastproof is selected over Improved Parry. \n\nFor Hard Doom Tower, you prefer 350+ resistance for higher stages, which is why Unshakeable is chosen as the T6 final mastery. If your gear allows for it Timely Intervention as T6 can be selected instead to cycle the turns more often. Finally, if the protection she provides is not sufficient you could also opt in for T6 Bulwark mastery specifically for Faction Wars as the other alternative",

HP is the next priority as it benefits her shield directly and makes her less likely to be a target. Accuracy is not needed for Melga.\n\nShield set can be used to provide more protection for your team as the start of each round. Alternatively Immortal and/or Regeneration sets are also great to keep her HP high through out the fight. In this guide, she was tested with the new DT set, the Guardian set that provides her 10% healing when she takes a turn (a bit like the Regeneration set) with the extra 10% damage mitigation for your entire team. The effect is pretty noticeable in dungeon runs. However, Melga is not picky and can work with any set combination as long as you reach the required stats. \n\nAs for accessories, many sets can be useful in different situation. Bloodshield from CVC acts as a fail safe against Scarab king as it does not trigger his counter attacks. Refresh accessories can allow her to spam her support skill more often.

Her A3 is one of the most powerful revives in the game because it combines high HP, TM and strong defensive buffs (DEF up + Strengthen) upon revival.\n\nHowever, there are a few things to note for this last skill. These defensive buffs are incredibly strong for Clan Boss, but the odd cooldown does not allow her to offer 100% uptime in regular tunes. Moreover, she fills her allies' TM on revive so using her against Grythion the Celestial Griffin (Doom Tower boss) is usually not advisable as he will gain the combined TM fill as well.\n\nFor masteries, Defense and Support trees are used here for a pure support build for PvE contents other than Clan Boss. If you want to use her in CB, offense down to Warmaster and Defense or Support depending on your needs is the way to go. The Defense tree to maximise her survivability and the Support tree to add some accuracy and extend buffs. \n\nFor Hard Doom Tower 350+ resistance is preferred for higher stages, so Unshakeable can be selected to meet that requirement. In this guide Timely Intervention was picked as T6 because the Resistance stat was achieved using gear and TI allows her to get her turns more often.",

      "desc": "One of Ursala's biggest weakness is that she doesn't have a skill to heal herself. \n\nFor dungeons 20+, you want around 220+ Resistance. 350+ for higher Doom Tower stages. In terms of Speed, over 200 would be best for her to cycle through her skills and lap waves. As for Accuracy to take advantage of her TM and atk down skill, 220+ for dungeons 20 and 350+ for Doom Tower Hard is required. \n\nEverything else should go to her Defense and HP. As you can see, Ursala can be hard to gear on higher stages if you want to use her as a debuffer while keeping her support capabilities high. The build showcased here is for a pure support/buffer Ursala. The debuffs are usually covered by other champions.\n\nFor sets, Immortal and/or Regeneration are great on her as it allows her to keep her HP high, survive and revive. You can also opt for Speed, Perception or even Relentless if you run a healer with Ursala.\n\nAs for accessories, Refresh and Cleansing can be useful but not mandatory. With her low base DEF, using DEF main stat on her accessories is advisable to shore up this weakness.\n\nGloves : HP%/DEF%\nChest : Resistance/HP%/DEF%\nBoots : Speed\nRing : DEF\nAmulet : DEF\nBanner :  Resistance/DEF/Accuracy",

He can be Replaced with any high HP champion in a shield set. \n- Sandlashed puts up Ally protection when a champion loses too much HP and prevents the team from being wiped.\n- Vogoth, an incredible healer in a Guardian set to give more protection to the team. \n- Rhazin was chosen as the nuker for this composition\n\nIf you don't have Sandlashed or Vogoth, using 2 champions in a Shield set is possible and you should avoid buff removers such as Serris or Sethalia if you're running it.\n\nA Defense based nuker is preferred because they can survive the attack from the opponents and their damage benefits directly from her defensive buffs. \n\nExamples :\n\nUrsala + Vogoth : https://youtu.be/Mj0h9Q67lZ4\n\nUrsala + Vogoth against blender : https://youtu.be/6xBbxlI14X0\n\nUrsala + Sandlashed : https://youtu.be/qjM3tJvaN5I\n",

She can be replaced with Arbiter, Gorgorab, High Khatun etc\n\n- Ursala is very good in this spot as she can buff either Attack or Defense, allowing her to enhance most nukers' damage. Her other skills are not wasted as she also increases your survivability in case your team has failed to finish off the opponent. Increase Defense was used here to make Rhazin hit harder.\n\n- Uugo works as an AOE Decrease Defense. She also brings a backup revive (or heal) and a Block Buffs debuffs that is extremelt useful against Seeker, Skullcrown and any teams that rely on buffs. She should be placed in the last position to reach maximum potential\n\n- Rhazin was the nuker here.

      "desc": "Candraphone is probably the most vicious go-second nuker in the current Platinum Arena metagame. \n\nCandraphone addresses one of the hardest issue for a go-second team: how do we balance enough defence to survive and still do enough damage to win? Whilst building strong defensive champions are a solution, Candraphone is one of the few attack champions (e.g. Rotos) that can do insane damage while having great survival skills. His abilities provide excellent potential for this:\n\n1.     [Veiled Defence] A4 passive places Perfect Veil (cannot be targeted and receives 15% less aoe damage) when enemy TM is filled – ideal for a go second team. Furthermore, he receives +40% less damage when veiled. This is equivalent to a 49% aoe damage reduction and can’t be targeted. \n2.     [Force Affinity] Force affinity makes him better against magic nukers (Trunda, Foli, Rae).\n3.     [Vicious Damager] When Candra is protected by Veil his damage is increased by 40% - this means his multipliers are: A1) double hit =12x, and A2) 7.4x. He also gains TM when damaged under veil, so his speed does not need to be too fast. He is especially effective when counter attacking using his A1 on buffed enemy champions – often hitting for 2x 120k damage on Defence champions.\n\nCandraphone masteries are selected to boost his damage and rely on team mates and gear to provide sufficient damage reduction to survive the first volley from the enemies.\n\n[Helmsmasher] is the key T6 mastery. In Late Game+ setting and especially when gearing for Platinum it's assumed you're able to reach at the very least 100% Crit Rate, 250%+ Crit Damage along other stats. In those circumstances Helmsmasher provides the best possible DPS increase out of all available masteries. If you're below 220% Crit Damage consider selecting Flawless Execution for more consitency.\n\n[Ruthless Ambush] and [Bring it Down] are great for the initial A2 nuke. [Retribution] and [Deterrence] are the target defence tree masteries to maximize counter attack opportunities using his amazing A1. \n",

Therefore, if no speed tuning or accuracy is needed, full damage build should aim for 5-6k attack, 260+% crit damage, 200ish speed, and of course 100% crit rate, making this build reasonably easy to achieve for end game players.\n\nGlove: Crit Damage \nChest: Atk%\nBoots: Speed \nRing: Atk\nAmulet: Crit Damage\nBanner: Atk\n\nCandraphone can benefit from the new jewellery that refreshes skills and reaction.

      "desc": "Candra is largely operated as a go-second nuker because his damage comes from being under Veil. There are two ways to do so:\n \n1. Go 2nd and get veil from enemy TM boost\n2. Have another faster champion like Duchess veil him. \n\nAs duchess is currently more advantageous for defensive teams in arena (good defence stats), Candra is an ideal go-second nuker with duchess or Rector. Some of the potential compositions are:\n\n1. Defensive Go second Team: Rector/Duchess, Ursuga/Krisk, Tormin/Hegemon, Candraphone - here the role of Rector/Duchess is Veil and revive, Ursuga/Krisk are for shields and bulwark defence, and Tormin/Hegemon force the enemy to use immunity. \n\n2. Counter Attack Team: Kymar, Valk, Duchess, Candra - here the idea is to cut into the enemy faster team, then put counter attack on candra and enable this to happen twice with Kymar\n\n3. Counter Nuke Hegemon Team: Arbiter, Krisk/Maulie, Madame, Candra - here the idea is to have everyone except Krisk/Maulie in immunity and then attack the enemy on the counter. Usually many nukers have survial issues against nuke hegemons but not Candra.\n\nVideo  – Candra go second team: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_jXU_acjK8 \n\nHere we show a strong defence team. The primary purpose of this team (popularized by MacChan https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFTERXtExfM&t=887s) is:\n\nI.        [Survive Turn 1] Usuga in first turn reduces damage through her passive (30%), her gear (10%) and her masteries (25%), Duchess reduces 25%, cumulating in a total 64.6% damage reduction in turn 1 from aoe critical hit.\nII.        [Go Second and Win] Duchess is able to put veil and attack up usually and Candra is able to aoe down the enemy nuker, get an extra turn, and take down their reviver. \n\nSome more Platinum Arena footage with different champions can be found in the following video\n\nhttps://youtu.be/6jUZbrdFBbs\n\nHowever, Candra is easily crowd controlled by AOE – unless there is block debuffs. Watch out for champions that can remove buffs like Serris and Sethalia!\n",

She was very lackluster on release, especially in comparison to Scyl of the Drakes who was given out earlier. Since her rework, she is certainly better. This guide showcases her in a Crowd Control build for Faction Wars, Dungeons and Arena.\n\nHer A1 provides a 15% TM decrease, her A2 provides an AoE Decrease Speed and an AoE Ally Protection and A3 provides AoE Provoke and a Shield on herself. Visix Provoke is already at 100% so only the rest of her debuffs needs booking to reach 100%. If you value consistency, booking them help. The reduced cooldown is also good. However, she can work well enough unbooked and that is the way she is showcased in this guide.\n\nIf you want her to use her A1 for TM reduction as much as possible you can even keep her unascended because sadly her AI does not prioritize A1 when TM of the target is high.\n\nUsually, for masteries, Offense/Defense or Offense/Support are used. T6 mastery choice depends on what you want to use her for. Eagle Eye in Support for the extra Accuracy can be a valuable pick. Warmaster on Offense for more damage against high HP opponents in PvE is a good alternative. \n\nHowever, as two of her skills are AoE abilities she's used with a stun set here, thus the Defense/Support build, and Fearsome Presence on T6 for extra chance of stun procs (Eagle Eye is an alternative).

However, he was recently buffed and while he is not a top tier champion, he is more usable now. \n\nThe core skill set of this champion did not change but was made improved by making his main debuff ability irresistible which means he no longer requires accuracy in his build and the most notable change was lowering the cooldown of his ability that places Increase Defense and Strengthen to 3 turns. This allows him to be tuned in a regular CB team. Strengthen is a rare buff and is the best damage mitigation buff in the game at the moment. Having this buff in a standard CB team can extend your team’s survivability in CB allowing more damage.\n\nIn terms of books, there are two options. You have to either book both his skills down to 3 turn cooldown making him much easier to speed tune or leave him unbooked with both skills at 4 turn cooldown. If you plan to use him in CB unbooked, you will have to tune him to go 4:3 to use his skills in the correct rotation.\n\nThis guide will feature Wurlim Frostking in PVE content of Dragon 20, Ice Golem 20, Fire Knight 20 and in a standard UNM and NM CB team.\n\nMasteries for Wurlim is fairly simple. Since he doesn't require accuracy to apply his debuff (apart from his A1 freeze which is not worth building accuracy for in most cases) we will avoid the Support tree and take the Offense and Defense tree. \n\nIn the Offense Tree, the standard PVE damage dealing masteries are chosen. Crit Rate, Crit Damage and all the damage increasing masteries on the left down to T6 Warmaster. In the Defense Tree, take the Damage mitigation mastery in Tough Skin, Blastproof, Delayed Death into both Counterattack masteries: Retribution and Deterrence.\n",

This is the best damage mitigation buff in the game and is extremely valuable in non-unkillable CB teams as it improves survivability allowing your team to last longer. He also provide a minor buff, Inc Crit Damage that helps increase your team’s damage.\n\nThis is an example of a CB team that is built to take advantage of Godseeker Aniri’s Buff extension.\n\n1)        Sepulcher Sentinel (227) – Atk Down, Inc Def, Block Debuff\n2)        Skullcrusher (171) Ally Protection, Counterattack\n3)        Rhazin (176) Dec Def, Weaken, DPS\n4)        Godseeker Aniri (173) Buff Extension, DPS\n5)        Wurlim Frostking (173) Strengthen, Inc Def, Inc Crit Damage, DPS\n\nWith Godseeker Aniri’s buff extension, this team is tuned so that Sepulcher’s Block Debuff is up for the Affinity Debuff and Stun which makes this team work on all affinities. Wurlim’s Strengthen and Inc Crit Damage buff are up for both AOEs which improves the team’s survivability and damage. Skullcrusher’s Ally Protection and Counterattack is up for both AOEs on all champions. Increase Defense is up 100% of the fight. There are a few turns of manual set up for this team to line up their skill order correctly before going full auto. \n\nAs you can see, the combination of defensive and damage mitigating buffs in an all Defense-based team allows the team to last a long time and comfortably hit well above the 2-key damage threshold for UNM and 1-key damage threshold for NM. Notice that both run ended due to missing Atk Down. The run could've lasted longer.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CgqC0MiIbE&t=5m17s\n\nNote that while this team’s speed tune work on all affinities there is still a factor of weak hits. While this team will not be affected by the Decrease Speed Debuff from the Spirit CB, Sepulcher and Rhazin who are the main debuffers in the team can still weak hit and not apply their debuffs. Missing the important Atk Down can end the run early.\n",

This guide will feature him Arena, Dungeons and FW. \n\nHis A1 places a Leech debuff that is very efficient in dungeons as well as in a Clan Boss setting for additional healing on hits. His A2 places an AOE Decrease Defense on a 3 turn cooldown when fully booked. His A3 fills his allies TM by 15% and decreases enemies TM by 15% and grants an Extra Turn. This Extra Turn mechanic is powerful because his A2 and A3 become 2 turn cooldown skills. It also allows him to be viable in 2:1 Clan Boss teams (other options being Seeker and Mashalled). As a bonus Deacon has a Speed aura for all battles which is a nice ability to have. \n\nDue to the short cooldown on his A2, he is used in a Stun set here to provide more Crowd Control. Hence the masteries choices. \n\nIf you plan on using him in CB, Offense down to Warmaster and then Defense for all the damage mitigation would be the choice. However, you should check very carefully what speed of every champion in the team compositions is and make sure not to pick any TM boosting masteries in CB teams. \n\nIn this guide to take advantage of his gear set, Defense and Support were selected. Defense for damage mitigation down to Fearsome Presence and Support to maximise TM boost, Accuracy and Lore of Steel to boost Speed and Accuracy whenever possible.

Deacon is not too picky about the sets he is using to work properly.\n\nIn terms of stats aiming for 250+ Speed and around 350 Accuracy for most PvE content is the benchmark. For Arena you can focus exlusively on speed.\n\nGlove: Any with Speed and/or Accuracy substats\nChest: Accuracy/HP%/Def%\nBoots: Speed\nRing: Def/HP\nAmulet: Def/HP\nBanner: Accuracy\n\nRefresh accessories work very well on Deacon to maximise his TM control opportunities.

Despite being a strong damage dealer, he is not well respected by newer players due to the team composition and gear requirements and has only started getting more attention from content creators recently. This guide will feature Fenax in Arena, FW and Dungeons progression.\n\nFenax main ability is his A1, a hard hitting skill with Block Revive property. It double hits when the enemy is under debuffs which is usually the case when you run a Decrease Defense to set Fenax up. This skill is incredibly strong, and having it on an A1 (meaning no cooldown is involved) makes him a viable option when you need this skill for content. His other skill have additional utility so some additional accuracy when possible is also advisable. His A2 has a chance to put either a Block Active Skill or a Block Buffs debuffs and his A3 has a chance to put Decrease Defense and Decrease Speed debuffs. Fenax has the potential to set himself up for his additional hits on A1.\n\nHis masteries are standard for most damage dealer in Late Game+. Offense tree with Crit Rate, Crit Damage for more dps into Helmsmasher T6. If you cannot reach 220% crit damage before picking T6, Flawless Execution is usually the preferred alternative. Support tree was selected as secondary tree to get more Accuracy when possible and Lore of Steel to boost Speed, Accuracy and Attack from the sets.\n\nYou can also opt in for Defense tree for more damage mitigation. The secondary tree does not make a huge difference for Fenax, but the gear and stats do.",

Note that his fragment in the Bazaar have a 24 hour cooldown so you have it buy it every day for 100 days. Don’t wait until you have all the points needed to buy all 100 before buying his fragment as this is mistake made by a number of people in our experience. \n\nDrexthar is one of the best DPS champions for 3 out of the 6 Doom Tower Bosses: Nether Spider, Griffon and Eternal Dragon due to his ability to passively place HP burn on hit. This is important as there are many other champions who can place AOE HP Burn, but they are usually on a cooldown skill and these 3 bosses have ways to negate the effectiveness of those AOE HP Burn skills with their abilities. Nether Spiderlings have Counterattack preventing champion AI from using their AOE abilities, Griffon removes Debuffs on itself, and Eternal Dragon blocks skill cooldowns. \n\nBooking Drexthar is not necessary but his effectiveness will improve with books. The Drexthar shown in this guide is not booked. This Late Game+ guide will feature Drexthar as the main DPS for the three Hard Doom Tower Bosses mentioned above.\n\nFor Masteries, Offense and Support Trees are recommended for Drexthar. In the Offense Tree take Crit Rate, Crit Damage and Lifedrinker down to the T6 Giantslayer since he has a triple hit A1. In the Support Tree, take the Accuracy masteries and all the two right hand options to improve his debuff placing capabilities.\n\nDrexthar can be flexible with his masteries should you wish to select Eagle Eye as the alternative T6 mastery or choose the Defence Tree as the secondary tree if you have enough accuracy on your gear.\n",

Similarly for accuracy at least 350 is recommended, however Drexthar has an amazing 70 Accuracy aura for all battles so if you use him as your lead, you can account for that in your build to lower the requirements. \n\nHigh HP, Defense and Speed are another priority. Around 50k HP, 4k Defense and 220 Speed are recommended. You can ignore Crit rate and Crit damage since he will not be doing significant damage through his regular hits.\n\nFor sets, the Regeneration set is useful to give him a constant source of self-healing since he needs to tank hits to proc his Passive HP Burn.

Note that his fragment in the Bazaar have a 24 hour cooldown so you have it buy it every day for 100 days. Don’t wait until you have all the points needed to buy all 100 before buying his fragment as this is mistake made by a number of people in our experience. \n\nIf you are lucky enough to get Drexthar before your Arbiter missions he can helpful in all dungeons for progression. Booking Drexthar is not necessary but his effectiveness will improve with books. The Drexthar shown in this guide is not booked. \n\nFor Masteries, Offense and Support Trees are recommended for Drexthar. In the Offense Tree take Crit Rate, Crit Damage and Lifedrinker down to the T6 Giantslayer since he has a triple hit A1. In the Support Tree, take the Accuracy masteries and all the two right hand options to improve his debuff placing capabilities.\n\nDrexthar can be flexible with his masteries should you wish to select Eagle Eye as the alternative T6 mastery or choose the Defence Tree as the secondary tree if you have enough accuracy on your gear.\n",

There is no Decrease Defense or Weaken in this team so, their Max Hp Damage doesn’t deal as much damage.

Void affinity allows her to avoid any weak hits. \n\nShe is a true glass cannon, both easily killed and very hard hitting. When coupled with a team of champions who can reliably place Decrease Defense, Weaken on opponents and Increase Attack and/or Increase Critical Damage on her, she can be incredibly useful at getting through higher level Dungeon content and the highest floors of Hard Doom Tower. \n\nHer A2 has the ability to ignore the DEF of the target if it's under the Weaken debuff that Whisper can place on the enemy with her A1. A3 can help her cycle through her skills faster. Booking her cooldown skills for Late Game+ is a good idea. \n\nWhisper is best suited by masteries that help her do as much damage as possible. Standard Crit Rate and Crit Damage masteries are a good fit. For her T6 mastery the choice is debatable. If you would like all her skills to hit hard and have more than 220+ Crit Damage Helmsmasher is a good choice for most content. If you only use her for the A2 ability that ignores DEF or have lower Crit Damage Flawless Execution would be the better option. Warmaster is not recommended as it's only good for bosses and Whisper is too fragile on most hard Doom Tower floors to be used there.  \n\nAccordingly the Defense Tree leading to Retribution is useful because Whisper is prone to taking big hits, and Blood Shield and Blood Thirst are useful to help the survivability of a fragile champion during the battles.

Aiming for 100% Crit Rate, 220%+ Crit Damage and 200+ speed is best.\n\nStats are better than sets, and while Whisper can receive extra benefit from the Relentless set, Cruel set, Savage set, Fatal set and Speed set for example, but they are not required for her to work.

He is an old champion that has been around for a while but remains one of the best for a large number of areas of the game. Ithos has a very high base attack with high damage multipliers and Void affinity so he can never weak hit, making him an incredibly consistent nuker and damage dealer. In the Arena, he is often a preferred choice against force enemies or mixed affinity enemies and in the Dungeons, he is a very consistent DPS since he can never weak hit.\n\nBooking Ithos is not necessary but is highly recommended as his main purpose is to deal damage and the damage increase gained from book will significantly improve his damage potential. Lowering the Cooldowns on his AOEs will be very relevant in Dungeon content. \n\nFor Masteries, we will select the standard Nuker Offense and Defense tree masteries. We will take the standard Crit Rate, Crit Damage, Heart of Glory and the two right masteries on T3 and T4. Whirldwind of Death, Cycle of Violence, Kill Streak, Methodical are great masteries for a PVE nuker as they allows Ithos to scale throughout the run. Finally T6 Helmsmasher is a good option if you can achieve the required 220+ Crit Damage.\n\nIn the Defense Tree, take Improved Parry for damage reduction against Crit, Bloodthirst for healing with each kill, Delayed Death for survivability and the T5 Retribution for chance to Counterattack.\n",

You might want to make small adjustments depending on your team, e.g. pick Stoked to Fury if you are using Gurptuk. However, the gear can vary depending on your team composition and needs.\n\nIf you are using Ithos in all other content as well, the Savage and Cruel sets with 100% Crit Rate as shown in the guide earlier are recommended as it will also function very well in a standard Arena team as well. This team will usually be the standard Speed team with TM Boost, Decrease Defense and Nuke strategy. You want to build Ithos with enough speed so you don't get speed cut by your opponents (see speed tune guide [1] to make sure your arena team is speed tuned). Selecting A2 priority in the AI setting can be helpful for maximum DPS output.\n\nAnother build is a specialty Arena build with Immunity or Untouchable set. In Immunity type sets, it is most common to build for a high crit rate (65-85%) but not 100% with high attack (5.5k+) and crit damage (250%+) as his A3 guarantees a crit. The 3 hit A2 does more damage and is good against targets that require multiple hits (Rotos) though. This build is mainly used against the popular Arena nuisance defences like Hegemon and Tormin. You can use the AI setting to prioritise A3 usage on arena.\n\nAs this type of Ithos is used often against slow annoying enemies of mixed affinities, not a speed team, speed tuning your team is not always necessary, but you usually want him with at least around 210-230 speed. \n\nGlove: Crit Damage \nChest: Att%\nBoots: Speed, or Att% with high speed sub-stats \nRing: Att\nAmulet: Crit Damage\nBanner: Att \n\n[1] Do visit https://www.deadwoodjedi.com/arena-calculator  for arena speed tune calculator.\n",

As with a standard Ithos, you want high attack (5.5k or more) and reasonable crit rate for A2 against Rotos.\n\nAn Immunity Ithos is most commonly paired with an Immunity Kymar, a Shield Set Champion for protection like Krisk or Maulie, and a Decrease Defense Champion that does not wake up the enemies from Sleep like Madame Serris. \n\nThis team functions with Prince Kymar being the fastest in the team and sleeping the Enemies. Since this team is usually used against slower teams, a well built Prince Kymar will usually go first. \n\nThen, Madame removes buffs on any that resisted Kymar's strip and places Decrease Defense without waking the sleeping enemies before Ithos Nukes. A Shield champion is in the team for protection against Hegemon Nuke. This team has the disadvantage of not having an Increase Attack Buff but benefits by having attack down and a safer 2-3 turn victory through Kymar resetting skill cooldowns so your team can go again. \n\nArbiter Madame is also quite good if you have an extra Arbiter to build in immunity to replace Prince Kymar, but there are risks of a speed gap between Arbiter and Ithos since there is no AOE sleep to CC the enemies so Ithos can safely take a turn.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/1tIzX2WAWJE",

This guide will focus on his performance in Faction Wars and dungeons.\n\nDhukk is often compared to Stag Knight as he also offers an AoE Decrease Defense and Decrease Attack in one skill on a 3 turn cooldown. Unlike Stag, this ability is booked up to 100%. However, you need Dhukk to have 100% crit rate to ba able to place all the debuffs so he might be more difficult to build early on. His Decrease Accuracy can be useful in some boss situations and his Provoke provides extra Crowd Control on waves. \n\nFor masteries, Offense and Support tree were picked. Offense tree down to Warmaster T6 is a typical dungeons build if you want to deal more damage against high HP opponents like bosses. These masteries also work for a Clan Boss scenario. \n\nSupport tree is selected to boost Accuracy when possible to meet Hard Doom Tower's requirements (350+ Accuracy ideally). If you can reach those numbers with just your gear or don't plan to use him for that content, Defense tree for damage mitigation is advisable. \n\nEagle Eye can also be picked if you struggle to reach higher Accuracy levels. Note that Sniper only works for his Decrease Accuracy on A1.\n",

In the Defense tree, choose the damage mitigation masteries in Tough Skin, Black Proof, and Delayed Death.

You can gear him with any gear that helps your achieve the desired stats such as Cruel, Perception, Speed, Crit Damage, etc.\n\nAs for stats, the most important stat to achieve is the correct speed. You need to reach the speed number depending on the type of 2:1 speed tune you are using. You may or may not need to build him with Accuracy but it is highly recommend to do so as Ma'shalled is still usable in other content in the game in this case.

      "desc": "Basher is a unique CC champion in the Skinwalkers Faction who can be played in a variety of late game content such as FW, Doom Tower and high G4/Platinum arena. The reason this champion is so desirable is due to his ability which locks out the enemy team - preventing them from using most of their cooldown abilities against you. \n\nHis A2 being able to increase the cooldowns of all enemy skills by 2 turns gives you enough breathing room to allow the rest of your team to set up and take out the enemy team safely or create a very tedious to beat tanky defence. This form of CC also bypasses block debuffs and cannot be 'cleansed' by conventional methods. The only way this form of CC would fail is if Basher did not meet the accuracy requirements. This skill is highly valuable and very similar to another ability possessed by Warlord - arguably one of the best arena champions in the game, thus making Basher earn his spot as a worthy late game void epic.\n\nAs an offensive arena champion that can lock enemy skills, you want your Basher to be as fast as possible to be able to go before the enemy team and lock them out. He can cycle through his abilities quicker and get back to his A2 which is why it is advisable to book his A2 to reduce the cooldown by one turn. Booking his A3 isn't particularly necessary for arena but can come in very clutch for PVE. Book this ability if you want to (somewhat) reliably depend on the block buffs for PVE content. His A1 does not need books.\n\nFor an arena Basher that is the focus of this guide select masteries that help aid in increasing his accuracy, provide some extra form of CC or give extra survivability. This is why as seen below, the Defence and Support trees have been chosen with Eagle Eye as the T6 mastery for sufficient accuracy in Arena.",

Otherwise, you will need to aim around 300+ speed if you only use 1 booster. You will also need to have a high level of accuracy to compete in end game arena. 450-500 acc will suffice for both Gold IV and low Platinum arena and DT. If you can squeeze additional HP% in then that's an added bonus. \n\nReaching these stats can be difficult but the most optimal sets to use would be Swift Parry. An alternative would be Immunity-type sets when battling against Tormins or hegemons, followed by either Speed or Perception sets with as much speed and accuracy rolls possible.  \n\nThe Swift Parry set allows for an annoying defence and even if you lose the speed race, Swift Parry can save your basher and allow him to use his A2 which might swing the fight in your favour.\n\nGloves: HP% with acc and speed substats\nChest: ACC with speed substats\nBoots: SPD with acc substats\nRing: HP \nAmulet: HP with acc substats\nBanner: Accuracy with speed substats\n\nBasher benefits from Refresh gear that grants a chance for the skills not to go on cooldowns as repeated A2 procs can lock down opposing teams longer.",

      "desc": "Husk is a Force Affinity HP Champion in the Undead Hordes faction, and this well-upholstered zombie is one of the handful of champions who have an ability that does damage based on Enemy Max HP. \n\nAs a HP-based champion, he can be built to be quite tough, and brings some useful debuffs to the table. Husk has a reasonable chance of provoking opponents with each of the two hits of his A1, especially when booked, which makes him an effective control against wave opponents and especially useful against the Magma Dragon. His AoE A2 not only hits based on Enemy Max HP (doing a bit less damage then Royal Guard's similar ability), but also has a 60% chance of stunning opponents when booked out, which means that he can be useful against both waves and bosses. Even in Doom Tower and level 21+ dungeons, where Enemy Max HP damage is capped, Husk can be a decisive factor in boss battles. \n\nMost of the time Husk has been completely eclipsed by Royal Guard due to affinity issues with the most popular dungeon for MAX HP Nukes - Spider 20. However, nowadays Husk has his own niche in PVE content.\n\nHusk benefits from all of the Masteries that maximise damage. At Tier 6, he can gain the largest benefit from either Warmaster, Helmsmasher and Flawless Execution. \n\nWarmaster allows him to do more damage against bosses with his A1 and his A3 at a slight cost of A2 damage. \nHelmsmasher and Flawless Execution favour the A2 slam and allow him to do more damage against waves. \nIt is generally recommended to use Helmsmasher if your Crit Damage is higher than 220%+ for maximum benefit.\n",

He is one of the rare champions who is better served by his A1 and A2 being improved by books than his A3, which does respectable damage at best and unless you build him specifically with his A3 in mind, does not have the utility of either of his other abilities. \n\nCritical Damage and Crit Rate should be high and Husk needs a decent level of Accuracy for his debuffs to land. Essentially, you need to decide whether to concentrate on Accuracy, Attack or HP, or to fall somewhere between them. It is easier to build Husk with high HP than high ATK, and with enough HP, Husk’s A3 can be deadly, but it is still not one of the biggest damage dealing abilities in the game. You might find that in a preset team you prefer not to use the ability at all, since the A1 Provoke is so valuable.\n\nYou can build him as an all–out damage doer, but there are many other champions, especially if you're in the late game, who do a better job of that, and you may find that his crowd control abilities are too useful to be wasted. \n\nThe build featured here is a hybrid build, intended to work in as wide a range of venues as possible.  It has a reasonable amount of HP, and enough Speed and Accuracy to be viable in dungeons and the Doom Tower. In preset teams, this Husk's AI is set not to use his A3. Stats are better than sets, and Husk benefits as much as any other champion from Speed and Divine Speed, Perception, Relentless, Lifesteal, Resilience and so on. Stun, Retaliation and Reflex sets can be very effective on Husk. If built with a lot of HP, a Shield set can defend Husk's entire team. With a Destroy set he can be a viable DPS option against the Scarab King. \n\nGloves: Crit Damage\nChest: HP%\nBoots: Speed\nRing: ATK, with HP% substats\nAmulet: Crit Damage\nBanner: ACC\n\nHusk can benefit from refresh jewellery if you have any spare ones",

However, there is one area of the game where he can be useful indeed and that is Faction Wars Crypts. With sufficient stats and masteries you can make a team that will be able to complete this crypt to get Lydia without legendaries or void epics! It is important that you don't want to build him too well and waste resources on the one hand. On the other he can do his job on minimal investment and that will be the focus of this guide.\n\nHis most important ability is a Decrease DEF on the A1 default skill that will help reduce the damage dealt by the Valkyries on the second wave and kill the boss quickly. It is also an ability that currently only a few champion in this faction posses. The base chance is 50% probability which is sufficient and there is no need to book Necrohunter. The other 2 abilities are simple dps skills and have decent multipliers. \n\nThis skill sets along with Warmaster T6 mastery makes it possible to kill the boss before it uses the ability to exchange life in 12 turns resets cooldown. Gravestorm has only a 50% chance to attack twice which makes it unreliable for consistent damage and is the mainly reason why this champion doesn’t have many uses outside of the faction.\n\nThe rest of the masteries are a semi-classic defense build with Retribution and Deterrence that focus on damage dealing and survival capabilities.",

This guide will focus on Sicia as a damage dealer for dungeons, Faction Wars, Arena and Doom Tower secret rooms.\n\nHer main skills are her A2 and A3 and those skills should be booked for best results. Her A3 places an AoE HP Burn then grants an extra turn if the HP Burn is placed on all enemies. This works even if she kills the enemy with the skill. Her A2 deals damage from the HP Burn and also places Decrease Defense and Weaken on all enemies. This means she can work alone especially if you use the AI presets to select skill priorities for using her AOE burn first. \n\nHowever, it is advisable to run her with another AoE HP Burn if you want her to be your reliable Decrease Defense and Weaken champion. This HP Burn detonation is very strong against the Spider as the damage is not capped at the moment unlike MAX HP and Poison burst strategies, making her the most important champion for speed farming this dungeon. Her A1 can extend the HP Burn keeping at least 1 enemy constantly under this effect.\n\nSicia is used here as a Debuffer/Nuker so Attack and Support trees were selected. Support tree gives her extra Accuracy and gives a chance to extend her Decrease Defense or Weaken. Attack tree down to Helmsmasher T6 to maximise her damage as a nuker especially in Arena. This build is good for most content except for the Spider's den as you actually don't want her to deal too much raw damage there.\n\nWhen used as a pure Debuffer, against the Frost Spider for example, going down Support to Eagle Eye T6 can be a good choice to reach the Accuracy needed (about 600 Accuracy). If you want to use her exclusively for Boss fights, Giantslayer is the mastery you should pick, especially against the Clan Boss for maximum sustained DPS. ",

Together this makes him a solid support even though his skills scale in damage with ATK.\n\nAvir's masteries are based around helping keep other champions on your team alive using a combination of his heal and the bulwark T6 mastery. Bulwark will help absorb some of the damage other champs are receiving to keep them alive and the support tree is mostly focused on the healing and the debuff aspect of his kit.",

The way his A2 works is that the Decrease Speed debuff is placed on targets under poison debuffs, but the toxic set places the poison before the move occurs, which allows you to get decrease speed debuffs a lot more often. \n\nAnother great aspect of Avir is that his heal is based off Avir's MAX HP, so one of the two most important things about his build is providing a high HP pool to make the heal bigger. Having enough accuracy to land debuffs is important, and the rest of the stats should go into speed and defense.\n\nGloves: HP%\nChestplate: HP%\nBoots: Speed\nRing: HP\nAmulet: HP\nBanner: HP/ACC\n\nIf you have spare refresh jewellery it can benefit Avir for more frequent healing usage",

She is quite unique as she offers a reliable 2-turn AoE Provoke allowing you to control enemies for an extended period of time. She is usually key to Faction Wars stage 21 clear on auto due to her effectiveness on the Valkyrie waves. This guide will cover her role in Arena, Faction Wars, Doom Tower Secret Room and Dungeons. \n\nUmbral's A2 and A3 are both highly prizes skills. A2 places an AoE Block Buffs debuff and A3 puts up an AoE Provoke for 2 turns. Both should be booked to get 100% chance for maximum efficiency. Her A3 also places an Unkillable buff on herself allowing her to tank even more comfortably. Being Void affinity, she does not weak hit and places the debuffs reliably. However, A3 also places a Block Active Skill on herself for 5 turn and it cannot be removed.\n\nFor Masteries, Offense and Support trees were picked here. Umbral does decent damage so selecting Offense tree can help with the dps. As for the Support tree, you want to pick the extra Accuracy, TM boost or Evil Eye for some extra TM control. \n\nUmbral has different builds so the choice of T6 can vary. If you want to build her full on as a nuker, Helmsmasher can be picked for T6. If you want her to have some sustained damage against Bosses, Warmaster T6 is the natural choice. If you want her to be your debuffer for high end content like Arena and struggle with the Accuracy requirement, Eagle Eye T6 is the way to go. ",

Despite this, most people keep him as a vault guardian and don't use him. In this guide we are going to demonstrate that he has a kit that can be very useful in various content in Raid. Specifically he can shine in a team of epic champions that can fully auto-complete one of the most difficult factions in the game - Knight Revenant.\n\nBergoth has a decent skill kit that can come in handy in various game content. His A1 has a 50% chance of applying a Continuous Heal if the attack is critical, which allows him to maintain this buff periodically, especially in CA compositions. This ability is complemented by his passive that heals his allies for 20% of the damage he receives. Although he requires 100% Crit Rate to place the continuous heal on the A1, it is not recommended to build him to do damage because his multipliers are quite poor. \n\nHis last ability is the main reason he is useful especially in Faction Wars. He has a 30% chance to apply AOE Provoke, that can be booked to 60%. This ability is very useful against the waves of Valkyries in the FW. As he does not have a 100% chance, it is not recommended to use this champion in the Arena since this is not reliable enough for CC.\n\nTo complement these abilities, the Fearsome Presence mastery is recommended  as the T6 mastery to maximise the chances of placing the Provoke debuff and Sniper for the continuous heal placement. Otherwise the usual Accuracy and TM boosting masteries are selected for more frequent skill application.\n",

[Control] You must try to control the enemy, especially if they are fast. A Sleep from Kymar or Stun or Provoke or even Freeze are very important. Here, Kymar serves this role well because he has speed aura, removes buffs, boosts TM, and can reset skills. But other and less high-end options include Maulie and Astralon and other epic provoke champions. Alternatively, a skill lock by Warlord or Basher are also viable.\n2.        [Attack Up] You need attack up here, by Arbiter, Brogni or other champions (effective against Tormin).\n3.        [Defence Down or Block Buffs] You can choose a variety of champions here. I have tested Ruel to do 220-240k aoe without Defence Down in savage, so there is no need to think Madame Serris is mandatory, but perhaps she is desirable more to strip buffs in case Ruel A3 is prevented from landing by Block Debuffs. Arbiter, Brogni, Gurptuk, Uugo, or even Ghostborn combining 2. and 3. are helpful.\n4.        [Vicious Damager] When Ruel has placed A3, he receives a massive 50% TM boost which will put him high up on the list of champions that take a turn. He will also give Accuracy Up buff to all allies which can help any further control and also weaken the enemy a bit.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/S2XTLz5LXdk \n\nPossible Ruel teams: \n-        Against Tormin: Kymar (sleep) > Brogni (attack up and block debuffs and shield) > Madame (against high resist block debuff heavy teams) or Gurp (against SP) > Ruel (A3 Hex) > Kymar boost TM > Ruel (A2 Nuke).\n-        Arbiter (attack up and boost TM) > Maulie or Krisk (provoke) > Madame (against high resist block debuff heavy teams) or Gurp (against SP) > Ruel (A3 Hex) > Kymar boost TM > Ruel (A2 Nuke).\n",

She can also deal good damage if built for it, making her a very flexible and generally useful champion to build. For the purposes of Mid-game she can work in any dungeons to keep the waves under provoke and help your squishy champions survive.\n\nConsequently, there can be 2 different builds for her masteries. For a debuffer build, Defense and Support trees are preferred to go down to Eagle Eye on T6. Eagle Eye gives the Accuracy needed for Dungeons if your gear is not strong enough to grant enough Accuracy and is generally useful for Arena where you want as much Accuracy as possible. Defense tree offers damage mitigation and can help removing debuffs on her with Resurgent, very useful against enemies with debuff on their auto attack. \n\nFor a nuker build, Offense and Support trees are picked, Support tree provides the Accuracy so she remains functional as a provoker. Helmsmasher T6 on offense allows you to deal more damage if you can build her with enough Crit Rate and Crit Damage (220+).",

To land the debuffs sufficient ACC and Crit Rate are needed because Decrease DEF will only be placed on his A2 if the skill scores a critical hit. This can be problematic at this stage as you may not have access to ACC banners and good substats to reach sufficient amount of ACC or Crit Rate. \n\nFor this reason Support tree is really important for additional accuracy substats.

Her versatile kit allows for her to be used in most content such as: FW 21, DT hard, UNM Clan Boss, Arena, and most dungeons. The main aspect to Martyr's kit is that she is one of only three champions in Raid that provides the AOE Counter Attack (CA) buff to the team making her an incredibly sought after champion in the game. In this section of the guide we will be covering her in Clan Boss.\n\nOn Clan Boss her A2 skill provides both Counterattack and Defence up. Furthermore, Martyr alone can consistently ensure that Defence Down is on a 100% uptime due to her A1. Due to Martyr counterattacking with her A1, you would be very unlucky for Defence Down not to land or your Accuracy is insufficient/CB is negative affinity. \n\nWhen picking Martyr's Masteries, you can choose the following:\n\n• If you want her Decrease DEF and Decrease ATK and you can reach 230 Acc with your gear choose Offence and Defence trees for extra DPS and survivability\n• If your other 4 champions can consistently land Atk/Def down debuff on the CB can also pick Offence and Defence trees and ignore Acc\n• If you need her debufs and can't get enough with her gear you can select Offence and Support trees to make up for the Accuracy deficit.\n\nOffence and Defence trees were chosen for this Late Game+ showcase. Martyr will be used mainly for her A2 to enable Counterattack and Def up on the entire team. Warmaster is a must as it ensures champions gets fully healed when going in for an attack or counter attack with a lifesteal set. Notable masteries leading up to Warmaster include: Deadly Precision and Keen Strike for extra damage, Single Out, Bring it Down and Methodical for extra damage against higher hp targets and longer fights.\n\nFor the Defence tree, Tough skin, Blastproof and Delay Death were taken for extra defence and survivability as well as Retribution and Deterrence for extra chance to counterattack.",

Aside from Defence, Crit rate and Crit dmg also play a role in delivering a lot of damage to the clan boss so ideally you would want to pump these numbers as high as possible. 220+ Accuracy is also needed if martyr is your only Def Down champ\n\nIn a classic 1:1 clan boss team, Martyr would need to be the slowest on the team (ideally 191 or 171 speed) to ensure that everyone gets 2 turns of Counterattack and Def up.

In particular, she does not need to be speed tuned and this allows to build her faster and lap the waves of enemies fo increased efficiency.\n\nMartyr's A1 has a 75% chance to land Decrease Def when fully booked. As her A1 is single target, Martyr will not be your primary Dec Def debuffer for waves and wave ads. Her A1 will however, ensure that Decrease Def is on a 100% uptime against bosses because of the high debuff chance followed by a Counterattack. \n\nMartyr's A2 is where she truly shines. Counter Attack is an incredibly valuable buff to have due to allowing your team to ensure debuffs from A1's land. Not only that, but counterattacking can trigger Warmaster/Giant Slayer procs which will also increase damage potential and ensure that your champs get fully healed (if wearing lifesteal). Martyr also provides a 60% Increase Def buff for your entire team ensuring high rates of sustainability.\n\nMartyr's A3 locks enemies out with Provoke and AOE Dec Atk. Ideally, you want Martyr to use her A2 first as these abilites synergise. It is advisable to book her A2 and A3 to get her on a consistent cycle of abilities. Her A1 doesn't require booking but can be very useful. Only book A1 if you need consistent Def Down on a single target.\n\nFor a dungeon focused Martyr, the Offence and Defence trees have been chosen - Warmaster for the T6 mastery, Retribution and Deterrence for the defensive T5 masteries. The route down to these masteries are all taken to increase Martyr's damage and survivability. If you are struggling with meeting the Accuracy requirements then going down the Support tree instead of the Defence tree would be advised for the extra accuracy.",

      "desc": "Due to the nature of Martyr's kit, she has some specific requirements that should be met when building her. Martyr needs a good level of speed, ideally, 191+ if achievable, as this will save you the hassle of speed tuning her for clan boss. It also is a good baseline for high level dungeons as she wont be too slow to be overwhelmed. 200+ speed is preferrable to lap the waves and go twice if you're not using her on CB.\n\nAccuracy and Defence also need to be taken into account. Purely for CB and dungeons, you would be aiming for 230+ accuracy and 4000+ defence to ensure she lands her debuffs and doesn't immediately get taken out since she'll often be targeted thanks to her Provoke. Martyr can also hit quite hard, so if you can reach these stats, 100% Crit Rate and as much Crit Damage as possible is wanted. \n\nMartyr's Aura of 33% DEF in all battles can help massively in helping reaching the 4000 mark for her Defence as just this aura allows her to gain slightly over 420 DEF. \n\nThe most universal set for Martyr is Lifesteal. Paired with the Warmaster mastery, she can keep herself alive in most situations. Speed, Accuracy and Perception are good alternatives if she can meet the stat requirements. There is another set that works quite well on Martyr outside of clan boss. The Frost set has some good synergy with Martyr's A3 meaning every attacker has a chance of being frozen for a turn just after they were forced to attack Martyr due to Provoke. This set has uses across the dungeons and Doom Tower, however Martyr will need additional support to ensure she is kept topped up in health if she is not using lifesteal.\n\nGloves: Crit Rate\nChest: Def%\nBoots: Speed\nRing: Def with Def% subs\nAmulet: Crit Dmg or Def \nBanner: Accuracy with speed subs\n\nAs the gear is very def orientated, reaching a healthy amount of hp can prove to be difficult.

However, she can be powerful to lockdown enemies if used correctly and can be the key to completing Faction Wars if you have not been blessed with alternative legendary pulls. This guide will showcase her in Faction Wars, Arena and Ice Golem 20.\n\nHer kit is pretty unique but also impratical due to the conditions on her HP lost and is sadly outclassed even by some Epics. Her A2 put champion's skills on cooldown and also affects any duplicates of that champion on waves. This makes Elegaius very powerful in Faction Wars stage 21 with multiple Valkyries. Her A3 removes 2 random buffs and also decreases TM of all enemies by 20%. This skill is also very strong against the Valkyries and useful in arena to remove Shields. Her passive is also interesting, preventing her from getting killed in one hit and is used in this showcase to tank the last Boss of Faction Wars.\n\nAs a support champion you have 2 different possible builds : one purely for debuffing, especially in arena and one more for the boss fight. The build showcased is of the first category. If you plan on building Elegaius for her debuffs, Defense and Support trees are picked. Defense tree provides general damage mitigation and as a HP based champion, she can be built tankier to take some damage from her allies hence Selfless Defender on T5 of Defense tree. Support tree provides extra Accuracy, with Evil eye being very useful for extra TM control and Eagle Eye T6 very important for more Accuracy.\n\nFor a more hybrid build, you should go for Offense and Support, with T6 Warmaster if you need that extra damage against waves and bosses.",

Her HP is also lower than the typical build to work as a tank so mobs and bosses target her. For stats, aim for 220+ Speed, ideally speed tuned with your booster and as much Accuracy as possible.

      "desc": "Dragon 25\n\nThis featured speed run consists of a Seer nuke team and a poisoner.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/sU2ewQu0cf8 \n\nThis team relies on Seer to nuke waves. Seer in a savage set can handle the enemies easily with a simple DEF DOWN de-buff and enough ally buffs. Seer’s A2 is disabled because her A1 can give her extra turns to help her cycle faster to Karma Burn. Although capped at 10% damage at the boss, this is one of the fastest ways to defeat Stage 25.\nLydia provides debuffs and buffs that enable Seer to do her job. The strengthen buff can also help the survivability of the team when the dragon inevitably gets a turn.\nPrince Kymar resets the skills to make Wave 2 run smoothly. He is the fastest one on the team, so skill AI needs to be adjusted. His opener can be set to either A1 or A2, so that he properly resets on the second wave. His normal AI should kick in and he should do his A3 reset skill cooldowns. Weak affinity means he will not land too many poisons.\nBlind Seer provides two buffs per ally during the waves for Seer. If DEF DOWN gets resisted by the enemy, Blind Seer can shield and revive the team. At the boss Blind Seer’s BLOCK-DEBUFFS and SHIELD help protect whenever the dragon does get a turn. \nZavia is a good Poisoner for Dragon 25. High Poison rate and can multiple applications with both her A1 and A3. Since the poison nuke is not effective and is capped at Dragon 25, her A2 is disabled in the AI Team Setup. Her default AI uses A3 during the waves, which is a much faster animation than her A1.\n\nNote for alternative poisoners.\n\nNethril and Occult Brawler are good alternatives as they are strong affinity. Nethril has a higher chance to apply poisons than both Zavia and Occult Brawler, but his animations are much slower. If you use Nethril to do his A3 as an opener set “Don’t Use” under Team Setup. Under normal circumstances (no skill resets), Zavia and Nethril will have similar clear times. \n\nIn the next slide we'll continue to explore Blind Seer in other PVE scenarios.\n",

The linked video features a speed run team build where Blind Seer provides buffs to enable Seer to melt waves and turn meter control on the Fire Knight. \n\nChances of failure are low because Blind Seer can always revive teammates if they die from the waves or Fire Knight. At the boss, her A1 provides decent control but needs additional turn meter reduction support from Alure. In case, Alure and Blind Seer get resisted, Blind Seer’s shield cancels out most of the damage or can pick the team back up. \n\nLydia applies AOE Decrease DEF and Weaken for increased dps potential along with extra buffs for Seer.\n\nSeer provides superior waves clear based on the amount of buffs\n\nAlure provides superior TM reduction on the boss and 3 hit A-1.

      "desc": "Hard Doom Tower Tormin waves.\n\nIn hard DT Blind Seer provides excellent coverage for your team. When facing multiple Tormins and other nasty debuffers and you don't want your team to Freeze while stacking buffs or getting TM boosts. Blind Seer should go first. She provides 2 buffs that are fewer than Mausoleum Mage, but she also has a full team revive in case things take a turn for the worst.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/3mlmYPsPNwo\n\nIn Floor 112 of Frozen Spider rotation,  there are three Tormins on the second wave. \n\nOn Wave 1, begin with Prince Kymar sleeping the enemy. Blind Seer immediately goes next and puts Block Debuffs and a HP shield on the team. Lydia will then apply her AOE Weaken and Decrease DEF. At this point, enemies will be woken up. For some later waves, enemies might be faster than Lydia and wake up from their sleep and waste their turn. Ma’Shalled will go immediately after Lydia. At this point, Seer will perform her AOE nuke and wipe them out. \n\nOn Wave 2, we have the challenge of dealing with three Tormins. Kymar will reset skill cooldowns and boost turn meter. Your lower resistance team might get frozen, but Blind Seer will not. Lydia is built with high resistance on this team and will put up Strengthen and Increase Speed. This will help the rest of the team get their turns back if they are Frozen.   The Tormins have a large amount of health so Lydia can reapply her debuffs and still be able to cycle by the end of the wave. Make sure the team has fresh skills to use on the next wave.\n\nOn Wave 3, we only deal with one Tormin again. The safer method is for Kymar to sleep the enemies and continue as normal and reset the skills for any enemies that have survived. The other method is to take advantage of the turn meter boost and reset skills if necessary.\n\nNote: When trying to revive with Blind Seer, her block damage might trigger Tormin to freeze all other team members.

      "desc": "Hoforees is a recent addition to the Skinwalker faction and a tremendous help to clearing the Faction Wars as he is a very reliable reviver for this faction. This guide will showcase him in Faction Wars stage 21 and Dungeons (Dragon and Ice Golem) stages 20 and 25. While Hoforees is not a champion suitable for speed runs he can work well in a progression setting.\n\nFor his skill kit, his A1 offers a small chance to Stun. It's good to have, but this was not the focus of the build. His A2 provides an Increase Attack and Increase Crit Rate. This works well if you have Attack based damage dealers in your team and worth booking along with the A3. His A3 provides a strong Revive skill on a 5 turn cooldown : He revives 2 random allies with 50% HP and fills their TM to 50%, then places a Strengthen buff on the whole team. Strengthen is a strong defensive buff that improves your team's survivability significantly.\n\nFor Masteries, there are many possibile routes. If you want Hoforees to provide some extra damage, Offense tree down to Warmaster is the standard choice. The secondary tree will depends on your needs (improved survivability with Defense tree or Accuracy and Buff extension from the Support). \n\nIn this build a Support build is featured, thus the Defense + Support choice. Defense tree increases his survivability for PvE content, Support tree provides more Accuracy, Buff extension and TM boosts. Lasting Gifts T5 and Timely Intervention T6 are very important for this role to ehance the buffs and allows him to cycle back the revive faster. If you want more Resistance, Unshakeable T6 from the Defense tree is also a viable alternative choice.",

If you want to keep him alive to ensure he can revive your team, there are 2 options : bring in a healer as an extra support or give him some form of self heal. With that in mind, Hoforees is using an Immortal set and a Regeneration set in this build. \n\nIf you are using a healer alongside him, Speed, Relentless or Reflex can be a good alternative to cycle through his cooldowns faster. For stats 200+ Speed, 2.5-3k Defense and as much HP as possible are wanted. Having some Resistance is also nice to improve survivability. Aim for 300-350 for PvE content.\n\nGloves : HP%/DEF%\nChest : Resistance/HP%\nBoots : Speed\nRing : DEF/HP\nAmulet : DEF/HP\nBanner : Resistance/HP/DEF\n\nFor accessories, Refresh can be good if you want him to have A2 and A3 off cooldown more often, Cleansing can be good if your Resistance is not high enough. \n",
